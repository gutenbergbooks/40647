<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a><span class="small">CHAPTER I</span><br />A SEARCH BEGINS</h2>


<p>Greta opened very sleepy eyes and
stretched a long, long stretch. Every single
morning, before she got out of bed, she put
her arms above her head and stretched as
far as she could reach. Greta wanted to
grow tall, and she thought that maybe if she
pulled her arms 'way up and her feet 'way
down, she would grow tall more quickly.
Greta had been named after the most famous
queen of Denmark, and so she wanted to be
tall and graceful, just as that queen had
been.</p>

<p>In about two minutes she jumped out of
bed and started to dress. If she dressed very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
fast, she would have time to run out to the
barn and see the kittens before breakfast.
The kittens were only a week old, and Greta
loved them every bit as much as their own
mother did. Greta lived on a very large
farm, and on the farm was a very large barn.
In fact, the barn was about three times as
large as the house Greta lived in. The barn
was built of red brick and it formed three
sides of a square. The house itself made
the other side of the square. It was also
built of brick, but it was painted white.</p>

<p>The horses were kept in one part of the
barn, the cows in another part, and the pigs
in still another part. Then there was one
large section where the hay was kept. When
the kittens were born, Greta made a nice soft
bed of straw for them in the farthest corner
of the barn, where the pigs and cows and
horses could not possibly reach them. Every
morning she ran out to see the kittens to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
sure that they were all right. She picked up
each of the four soft, furry little animals and
gave it a special hug before she went off to
school. And when she came home from
school she played with the kittens until it
was time for dinner.</p>

<p>Of course Chouse didn't like this one little
bit. Chouse was the wire-haired terrier, and
he had always been Greta's special pet. In
the summer he played with her every minute
of the day. But things were very different
now, since the kittens had come. Greta
didn't pay much attention to Chouse. The
kittens took every minute of her time. Just
the same, Chouse was waiting for her this
morning outside her bedroom door. Breakfast
would be ready in five minutes, so Greta
ran quickly, with Chouse barking at her
heels. All out of breath, she reached the
farthest corner of the barn, where the kittens
had their bed of straw.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Greta stopped very still. She rubbed
her eyes. Surely this was just a bad dream.
The soft bed of straw was empty. No one
would have taken her kittens, and none of
the horses or cows or pigs could reach them.
Where in the world could they be? She began
to look all over that end of the barn,
poking about the straw that covered the
floor. There wasn't a sign of the soft balls
of fur. Two large tears rolled down Greta's
face. Just then she heard her brother Hans
calling.</p>

<p>"Greta, where are you? Breakfast is all
ready and we are waiting for you."</p>

<p>There was such a big lump in the little
girl's throat that she could hardly answer.
Finally she said, "Here I am, Hans, but my
kittens are gone."</p>

<p>"Gone? What do you mean?" Hans had
found her by now and he put his arm around
her shoulder. "Don't cry, Greta. We'll find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
them all right. Come on to breakfast now."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/illus013.jpg"><img src="images/th_illus013.jpg" width="400" height="240" alt="GRETA&#39;S HOME" title="GRETA&#39;S HOME" /></a>
<span class="caption">GRETA&#39;S HOME</span>
</div>

<p>"I don't think I can eat anything, Hans.
I wish I didn't have to go to school today. I
want to look for my kittens."</p>

<p>"I'll help you look for them as soon as we
get home from school. Come on, now.
Mother and Father are waiting."</p>

<p>So Greta wiped the tears from her face
and went into the house with Hans. She sat
down at the table, but the lump just wouldn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
go out of her throat, and she could hardly
swallow.</p>

<p>"Remember, Greta, there are only two
more days of school, and then you will have
all summer to play with the kittens." Hans
tried his best to cheer up his little sister.
Hans was fifteen years old, so of course he
couldn't possibly be upset over a little thing
like the loss of four small kittens.</p>

<p>"Maybe Chouse has hidden your kittens,
Greta," suggested her father. "Day before
yesterday I saw him chasing the baby pigs.
I punished him for that, but he didn't seem to
learn, for yesterday he was chasing the baby
chickens and he killed two of them. Now
you know we can't have that sort of thing
going on. I think we had better send Chouse
away to some other farm."</p>

<p>Greta could hardly believe her ears. "You
don't really mean that you would send
<i>Chouse</i> away?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I mean just that, Greta. We can't
have a dog that is destructive. And if he has
hurt your kittens, I don't think you would
want to keep him, either."</p>

<p>Greta didn't say a word, but a choking
feeling came into her throat.</p>

<p>"Finish your breakfast, Greta, or you will
be late for school," reminded her mother.</p>

<p>Greta went to school in the village, a mile
away. When the weather was good, she rode
her bicycle. But whether she walked or rode,
Chouse always went with her to the door of
the school. And he was always waiting for
her when school was out in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Greta didn't know her lessons very well
that day. Her mind was on Chouse and the
kittens. She couldn't bear the thought of
losing her playmate, and yet, if he had hurt
the kittens, maybe he ought to be sent away.
Suddenly she heard the teacher call her
name.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>"Greta, what was the Union of Kalmar?"</p>

<p>Greta's thoughts were far away from Danish
history, and it was hard to bring them
back. Everyone in the room was looking at
her. Slowly she rose to her feet.</p>

<p>"The Union of Kalmar took place in 1397,
when Norway and Sweden came under the
rule of Denmark." Gradually it was coming
back to her.</p>

<p>"And who was the ruler of Denmark
then?" asked the teacher. "You should
know that, Greta, better than anyone else in
the class."</p>

<p>Greta's cheeks flushed a bright pink. How
could she have forgotten?</p>

<p>"Queen Margrete brought about the
Union of Kalmar," explained Greta. "That
is why she was the greatest queen Denmark
has ever had." The other children smiled
when Greta said this. They all knew that
her name was really Margrete and that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
had been named for this famous queen of
long ago.</p>

<span class="caption">HANS, GRETA, AND THE KITTENS</span>
</div>

<p>Greta thought it was the longest day of
her life, but school was finally over. Chouse
was waiting for her at the door when she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
came out of the building. He was such a
faithful little playmate, how could she bear
to send him away? Well, maybe she wouldn't
have to.</p>

<p>She got on her bicycle and rode home just
as fast as her legs could pedal. Before she
went into the house she looked again in the
barn to see if the kittens had, in some wonderful
way, come back to their bed of straw.
But the bed was still empty.</p>

<p>Hans helped her search every part of the
large barn&mdash;where the horses were kept,
where the cows were kept, where the pigs
were kept, and where the hay was kept. They
took sticks and poked around in the hay. At
last the children decided that the kittens
simply were not in the barn at all.</p>

<p>"Let's go look in the chicken house,
Greta," suggested Hans.</p>

<p>So they looked all through the chicken
house just as carefully as they had looked in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
the barn. But still there was no sign of the
dear little kittens.</p>

<p>"Oh, Hans, what am I going to do?" Greta
was crying now as if her heart would break.
"Do you think that Chouse has taken them
away some place?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't think so, Greta. But maybe
one of the Nisser has carried them off."</p>

<p>"Oh, Hans, why would a Nisse take my
darling kittens?"</p>

<p>"Well, if you do something to make a Nisse
angry at you, he is bound to punish you in
some way."</p>

<p>The Nisser are the little fairy folk, or
brownies, that live in every home in Denmark.
If you are kind to them, they will do
something nice for you; but if you hurt them
or make them angry, they will punish you.</p>

<p>When Greta went to bed that night she
pulled the warm feather cover tightly around
her shoulders. She wasn't exactly afraid of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
the Nisser, but she felt much better when
she was all covered up. It was late in June,
but the nights were quite cool. Greta was
glad that her mother had left the feather
cover on her bed. It was a large, thick cover,
but it was light and warm, for it was filled
with duck feathers.</p>

<p>Soon Greta fell asleep, and all night long
she dreamed that a little Nisse was sitting
on the foot of her bed, saying, "Greta, do
you <i>really</i> want your kittens back again?"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a><span class="small">CHAPTER II</span><br />THE SEARCH CONTINUES</h2>


<p>Greta was up earlier than ever the next
morning. Maybe the Nisser had decided not
to punish her after all. Maybe the mysterious
little creatures would bring her kittens
back. So Greta dashed out to the barn to
look. But the bed of straw was still empty.</p>

<p>All day long there was sadness in her
heart. The other children at school were
very gay, for this was the last day of school.
There was much singing and there were
many games. There was more singing and
games and laughter than there were lessons.
But Greta was not gay. She kept thinking
of her lost kittens, and every now and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
there was the awful fear that she might lose
Chouse, too.</p>

<p>She hurried home from school even faster
than the day before. Chouse had to run, run,
run to keep up with her bicycle. He barked
and barked, as if he wanted to say, "Greta,
don't go so fast." But Greta kept right on
going. Nothing could stop her. She rode
right up to the barn door and ran inside.
Maybe the kittens had come back. But no,
the bed of straw was empty.</p>

<p>Then Greta remembered that she had not
looked in the garden. Maybe the kittens
were out there playing, and the Nisser hadn't
taken them at all. Joyously she ran across
the courtyard, with Chouse close at her heels.
Chouse thought his little mistress was going
to play with him again, as she used to do, so
he ran on ahead of her and hid under a peony
bush. He lay there without making a sound,
waiting for Greta to find him. But Greta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
paid no attention to the little wire-haired terrier.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/illus023.jpg"><img src="images/th_illus023.jpg" width="400" height="325" alt="THE ROAD TO SCHOOL" title="THE ROAD TO SCHOOL" /></a>
<span class="caption">THE ROAD TO SCHOOL</span>
</div>

<p>She walked slowly up and down the garden
paths, looking carefully to the right and
left. Then she began to look under the rose
bushes and the peony bushes and the big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
clumps of iris. After a while Chouse came
out from his hiding place and followed his
young mistress all around the garden. It
was no use trying to get her to play with
him.</p>

<p>It took a long time for Greta to search
the entire garden. Every home in Denmark
has a flower garden, and this was one of the
largest and prettiest for miles around. Greta
looked under every inch of the thick hedge
that surrounded the garden. She looked all
through the bed of marigolds and the bed of
poppies and the bed of tulips. By this time
Chouse seemed to know that she was searching
for something and he tried to help her.
He began poking into all the flower beds
himself. While they were in the midst of
their search, old Peter, the gardener, came
along and stopped to watch them.</p>

<p>"Chouse, you naughty dog, get out of the
flower beds!" Old Peter was angry. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
had worked very hard all spring to make
the garden beautiful. For many hours he
had raked and hoed and watered the flower
beds. And now, in ten minutes, this naughty
Chouse had undone all his work.</p>

<p>"Oh, Peter, I've lost my kittens and Chouse
is helping me look for them. Please don't
scold him." If Peter complained about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
Chouse, then her pet surely would be sent
away, thought Greta.</p>

<p>"Lost your kittens, Greta? Well, now,
that's too bad. Maybe I can help you find
them."</p>

<p>So old Peter took his hoe and he started
poking among the flower beds, too. He poked
and he poked, but not a kitten did he find.
Greta got down on her hands and knees and
looked and looked, but not a kitten did she
find. And Chouse poked and scratched and
dug up the earth, but not a kitten did he find.
The kittens just weren't there.</p>

<p>Every evening, between nine and ten
o'clock, the family gathered in the living
room for coffee. This was an old, old custom
in Denmark, where the people like coffee better
than any other drink. Greta was usually
in bed by nine o'clock, but since there was
no school the next day, her mother let her
stay up with the rest of the family. Instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
of coffee, Greta had a bowl of strawberries
and cream. They were large, sweet berries,
fresh from the strawberry patch on the farm.
June was the strawberry month in Denmark.
They seemed to grow everywhere, and everyone
ate them, three or four times a day.</p>

<p>Greta said hardly a word all evening. She
was afraid to ask her father what he was
going to do with Chouse. Maybe he would
forget the whole matter if nothing were said
about it. And she didn't mention the kittens,
for that would bring up the subject of
Chouse.</p>

<p>Greta's mother noticed that the little girl
was unusually quiet.</p>

<p>"Greta, how would you like to have Anna
come and visit you this summer?" her mother
asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mother, that would be wonderful."
Greta's face was one big smile. Anna was
her cousin, and she lived in Copenhagen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Four years ago she had spent the summer
on the farm with Greta and Hans, and the
three children had had fun together all summer
long.</p>

<p>"You can write her in the morning and
invite her to visit you."</p>

<p>Greta ran across the room to her mother
and gave her a big hug. "Oh, Mother, you
are <i>so</i> sweet!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>Greta's mother smiled. She understood
little girls. She knew that Greta had been
sad, and she wanted to make her happy.</p>

<p>"I guess Anna is quite a big girl by now,
Greta. Let's see. She must be thirteen
years old."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose she will act like a young
lady? Or will she want to play with me?"</p>

<p>"Her mother says she is quite a tomboy,
so I'm sure she will want to play with you."</p>

<p>"Shall I ask her to bring her bicycle?"
After her family and her dog and her kittens,
Greta liked her bicycle better than anything
else in the world. She knew that she
wouldn't want to leave <i>her</i> bicycle at home
if she went away for the summer. So surely
Anna would like to bring hers along.</p>

<p>"She doesn't need to bring her bicycle,
Greta," said Hans. "She can use mine."</p>

<p>"Yes, I think that will be best, Greta," said
her mother.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>"And I'll let her use my new boat, too,"
added the boy.</p>

<p>"Why, Hans, you won't let <i>me</i> use your
boat."</p>

<p>"But you are only ten, and Anna is thirteen,"
argued Hans.</p>

<p>"Even if I am only ten, I can paddle a
boat."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>"Time for bed now, Greta," reminded her
mother. She didn't want the day to end in a
quarrel.</p>

<p>"I'll get up early, Mother, and write Anna
the very first thing."</p>

<p>Greta kissed her mother and father good
night and started to bed. Her own little
room was just across the hall from the living
room. The dining room, the living room, and
three of the bedrooms were on the second
floor of the house. On the first floor there
was the kitchen, the maids' rooms, and the
large office for Greta's father. Greta liked
her little room, and she especially liked the
balcony that was just outside her room. It
was a small balcony looking out over the
courtyard. It was fun to play on this balcony
and to pretend that she was an actress bowing
to a large crowd of people.</p>

<p>Just as she was ready to jump into bed,
Greta heard a scratching sound on her door.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
It was Chouse, who felt very much neglected
because Greta had forgotten to pat him good
night. This was the first time she had forgotten
it, but Chouse hadn't forgotten. So
there he was.</p>

<p>Greta hugged him tight. "Oh, Chouse, I
<i>can't</i> let Father send you away. Whatever
would I do without you? Even if you did hide
my kittens, I don't want to lose you. And
you <i>will</i> be a good dog, won't you?"</p>

<p>Chouse barked once, which meant "Yes,"
and Greta hugged him again, just for luck.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a><span class="small">CHAPTER III</span><br />A RIDE DOWN THE RIVER</h2>


<p>Greta read her letter over carefully to see
if all the words were spelled right. This is
what she had written to Anna:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"<i>Dear Anna:</i></p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>I would like to have you come and visit me

fun. Hans says you may use his bicycle and

small.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>I had four darling little kittens, but now
they are gone and I can't find them anywhere.
Do you suppose a Nisse took them
away?</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>
<p class="blockquot"><i>Chouse, my dog, has been very naughty
and Father says he may have to send him
away. I hope he won't, because I like to play
with Chouse.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>Come as soon as you can. Mother and
Father and Hans all send their love. So do I.</i></p>

<p style="padding-right:5%" class="blockquot right"><i>Your cousin</i></p>

<p class="blockquot right"><i>Greta.</i>"</p>

<p>She addressed the envelope, writing "Copenhagen"
in very large letters. Just as
she was going out of the door, her mother
called to her.</p>

<p>"When you are in the village, Greta, please
stop at the bakery and bring back some
bread. I told Marie to bake an extra loaf
today, but she forgot it. And we have company
coming tonight."</p>

<p>"All right, Mother. I won't forget."</p>

<p>As Greta rode into the village she thought
of all the things that she and Anna could do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
that summer. She didn't have to pay much
attention to cars coming down the gravel
road, for there were many more bicycles
than automobiles. Chouse ran right along
beside her bicycle, but once in a while, when
he saw a rabbit, he would suddenly dart away
into the field. In a short time he would come
tearing back and soon catch up with Greta.</p>

<p>The fields were especially beautiful right
now. The hay was yellow and almost ready
to cut. Greta could see for several miles in
every direction, for the land was flat and
there were not many trees. In this part of
Denmark the trees do not grow very large
because of the wind that blows all the time,
summer and winter. This wind from the
North Sea never seems to stop blowing, and
it blows so hard that the trees all lean to one
side, away from the wind. There are scarcely
any branches on the side that the wind comes
from.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>The farmers are thankful for this wind
from the sea, because it keeps their windmills
turning. And from the windmills they
get electric power to light their houses.</p>

<p>Greta mailed her letter and started back
home. She didn't stop to visit with any of
her friends in the village, because she was
eager to get home and look for her kittens
again. She hadn't given up the hope of finding
them, though she really didn't know
where to look. When more than halfway
home, she suddenly remembered the loaf of
bread.</p>

<p>"Come, Chouse. We must go back to the
village." Chouse had run to the side of the
road, looking for rabbits again.</p>

<span class="caption">A BARBER&#39;S SIGN</span>
</div>

<p>From away down the road, Greta could see
the sign of the bakery. Shaped like a large
pretzel, it hung 'way out in front of the store.
Every bakery had a sign like this, and many
of the other shops had their own special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
signs. Each barber shop had a large metal
plate hanging out in front. The plate was
cut in a deep curve on one side, where it was
supposed to fit around a man's neck when
he had his hair cut. Of course barbers didn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
use plates like this any more, but these signs
were still used to mark a barber shop.</p>

</div>

<p>When Greta got home, Hans was just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
getting ready to start out in his new boat.</p>

<p>"Want to come along, Greta?"</p>

<p>"Sure I do. Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"Oh, just down the river." The little river
which ran in front of the house and wound
around through the fields seemed like the
nicest part of the farm to Hans and Greta.
They fished in the river in the summer and
skated on it in the winter. Hans was proud
of his new boat, which was a birthday present
from his father. Although he never let
Greta go out in it alone, he often asked her
to go with him.</p>

<p>"Wait just a minute, Hans. I must take
this bread in the house and then I'll go with
you."</p>

<p>Chouse was already in the boat when Greta
came out. The minute that Hans started toward
the boat, Chouse always jumped in
ahead of him. He never sat still in it long.
He would dash back and forth from the front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
to the back, and every now and then he tried
to jump out, when he saw a rabbit running
across the field.</p>

<span class="caption">CHOUSE LIKED THE BOAT</span>
</div>

<p>"Are you going to let me paddle, Hans?"
asked Greta.</p>

<p>"Maybe I will, after while."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>Greta had to be content with this sort of
a promise. She was very happy just to be out
in this beautiful new boat. By the time they
had gone around the first bend of the river,
Greta began to think of her kittens again.</p>

<p>"Hans, do you think that a Nisse really did
take my kittens away?"</p>

<p>"Well, of course, I don't <i>know</i>, Greta. But
it looks like it."</p>

<p>"I thought you didn't believe in the Nisser,
Hans."</p>

<p>"Why, one <i>has</i> to believe in the Nisser.
There is just no other way to explain some of
the things that happen."</p>

<p>"Do you remember the time my doll disappeared
and I couldn't find her for months
and months?"</p>

<p>"Sure I do. And then all of a sudden she
appeared again."</p>

<p>"And you know, Hans, how I had looked
simply <i>everywhere</i> for that doll."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes. And then you found her under the
bed in your room. That is why I say that
you have to believe in the Nisser. There is
no other way to explain things like that."</p>

<p>While they were talking, Chouse had been
running back and forth in the boat. Suddenly
he put his front feet up on the side and
started barking. He barked and barked and
wagged his tail. He was trying so hard to
tell them something.</p>

<p>"I guess Chouse sees a rabbit. He wants
to get out of the boat."</p>

<p>"Let's let him out, Hans, and see what he
does."</p>

<p>Hans quickly turned the boat and paddled
over to the shore. Chouse jumped out before
the boat had even touched the bank. In fact,
he almost fell into the river, he was in such
a hurry to get out. Then he ran across the
field and was soon out of sight, swallowed up
in the field of hay.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hans, please let me paddle now."</p>

<p>"Wait until we get around the next bend
in the river."</p>

<p>Hans's boat was still so new that he liked
to paddle it himself.</p>

<p>"Well, all right." Greta was disappointed,
but she had to be content.</p>

<p>Hans pushed the boat away from the shore
and paddled down the middle of the river.
The river was quite straight here. Greta
thought that the next bend was very far
away indeed. And it seemed that Hans was
purposely going just as slowly as he could.
Oh, why did he want to tease her this way?
Greta hoped that her father would get her a
boat when she was fifteen years old. But
that was a long time off&mdash;five whole years.</p>

<p>"I wonder where Chouse has gone, Hans."</p>

<p>"Oh, he's chasing rabbits all over the field."</p>

<p>Just then they heard Chouse bark, but it
was a very faint bark, as if he were far away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
The children looked and looked, but they
couldn't see him anywhere. He barked
again, and this time it sounded a little bit
louder, but he was still out of sight. As
Greta and Hans went on down the river, the
barking got louder and louder.</p>

<p>"Oh, Hans, I see Chouse," cried Greta in
great excitement.</p>

<p>"Where is he, Greta?"</p>

<p>"He's way down there in front of us, right
down by the water near that group of trees.
Hurry, Hans. Let's see why he is barking."</p>

<p>Hans pushed the boat forward with strong,
swift strokes. He knew exactly how to handle
his boat, and in no time at all they had
reached the group of trees that was growing
by the edge of the water.</p>

<p>"Oh, Hans, the kittens! There are the kittens!"
Greta stood right up in the boat.
"Hurry, Hans. One of the kittens is in the
river."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>"You'd better sit down, Greta, or you'll be
in the river yourself."</p>

<p>With one strong stroke of his paddle,
Hans drove the boat against the grassy bank.
Both children jumped out and ran over to
Chouse and the kittens. One kitten was
lying on the grass, but it looked more like
a rat than a kitten. Its soft fur was soaking
wet. Chouse was working hard to pull the
other kitten out of the river. Finally he got
it up on the bank just as Hans rushed up to
help with the rescue.</p>

<p>"Oh, Hans, the poor little things are almost
drowned." Greta picked up the two
mewing kittens and held them close to her,
trying to make them dry and warm and comfortable.</p>

<p>"It certainly is lucky that we came along
when we did," said Hans. "Or rather, it's
lucky that Chouse was hunting rabbits along
here."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>"But where are the other two kittens,
Hans?"</p>

<p>Hans didn't answer right away. He
walked along the shore for a little distance,
stopping now and then to look carefully in
the water. At one place he got down on his
knees and looked. Then he walked back
quickly to Greta.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid we shall never find them, Greta.
Come on. Let's go home so that we can get
these kittens really dry and warm. We must
give them some warm milk, for I know they
are hungry."</p>

<p>All the way home Greta was very quiet.
She took off her sweater and wrapped it
around the kittens, holding them in her lap.
Suddenly she looked up at Hans with a smile.</p>

<p>"Hans, this certainly proves that Chouse
didn't try to do away with the kittens, for he
was the one who <i>rescued</i> them. Surely
Father won't send him away now."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know, Greta. I saw Chouse chasing
the chickens again yesterday."</p>

<p>"Did Father see him?" asked Greta with a
worried look.</p>

<p>Hans was in a teasing mood and he didn't
answer Greta right away. Finally he said,
with an annoying smile on his face, "I think
I'd better not tell you, Greta."</p>

<p>"Oh, Father, I'm afraid to go any higher."
Greta clung to her father's arm in terror.
This was the first time she had climbed up
the lookout tower in the forest, and even now
she was only halfway up. It seemed such a
fearfully long way to the top.</p>

<p>"I just can't go on," the little girl pleaded.</p>

<p>"Why, Greta, for months you've begged to
climb up here."</p>

<p>"But I didn't know it was so high."</p>

<p>"You won't be scared if you don't look
down at the ground. Just hold tightly to my
hand and you will be all right. Remember,
Greta, a girl who is named after a queen
must not be afraid of anything."</p>

<p>"All right, Father, I'll go on."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">AT THE TOP OF THE TOWER</span>
</div>

<p>In no time at all they reached the very top
of the tower, which stood in the middle of the
forest.</p>

<p>"Why, Father, I can see all of Denmark
from here."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>Her father laughed. "Not quite all of it,
Greta. But you can see all of our farm and a
good many other farms, too. By the way,
Greta, just how large <i>is</i> Denmark?"</p>

<p>"I thought school was over for the summer,"
laughed Greta. "But I'll tell you anyway.
Denmark covers exactly 16,574 square
miles. Besides that, Denmark owns Greenland
and the Faroe Islands. Any more questions,
teacher?"</p>

<p>"Not right away. I'll try to think up a
really hard one next time."</p>

<p>Greta's father began looking closely at the
forest. He was very proud of the rows and
rows of sturdy evergreens that covered a
hundred acres of his farm. Each year a certain
number of trees was cut. Some of them
were sold, and some of them were used for
fuel. But always, every year, new trees were
planted to take the place of those that were
cut.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>Greta was gazing off into the distance, but
suddenly her attention was caught by
Chouse, who was running along the road that
led to the tower. If only her father didn't
see him, thought Greta. Not a word had
been said about Chouse for the last two days,
and Greta hoped that the whole matter had
been forgotten.</p>

<p>When Chouse reached the foot of the
tower he began barking loudly. He had
never climbed the tower and he wasn't as
brave as Greta, for he didn't even try. He
just kept on barking and barking and barking.
Greta called to him, but he paid no attention.
He merely barked more loudly than
before. Of course her father heard him.</p>

<p>"What's that dog up to now, Greta? I
guess you'll have to go down and see what
he wants. Are you afraid to go down the
tower alone?"</p>

<p>"No, of course I'm not afraid." Greta was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
glad of the chance to show how brave she
really was.</p>

<p>But when she got down and patted him,
Chouse still kept on barking. Something
was the matter, but Greta couldn't imagine
what it was. Soon her father came down,
and Greta could see that he was annoyed.
Chouse rushed up to him and barked, trying
so hard to tell him something. The dog
dashed down the road a short distance and
then ran back, barking furiously all the time.</p>

<p>"I guess we shall have to follow, Greta."</p>

<p>When Chouse saw that they were following,
he stopped barking and was quite content.
Once in a while he would run on ahead
in a great hurry. Then he would run back
to Greta and her father and bark again.</p>

<p>"There must be something wrong in the
forest," said Greta's father. "I have never
seen Chouse so upset."</p>

<p>"You were just up in the tower, Father.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
If there had been a fire, you would surely
have seen it."</p>

<p>"Maybe not, because I was watching the
men cutting the trees, trying to decide how
many we should cut this year. I hadn't
looked over the rest of the forest yet."</p>

<p>A forest fire is a dreadful thing in this
part of the country, where the wind from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
the North Sea blows all day long. It can
blow a fire in front of it until all the trees
are gone. That is why the forests are always
watched so carefully.</p>

<p>Suddenly Chouse darted off the main road
into a narrow path. Greta and her father
followed right at his heels, for they knew
that the dog was leading them somewhere.
This was his only way of telling them something
that he thought they should know.
Soon he turned off to still another path.
Never for a moment did he hesitate. Chouse
knew exactly where he was going.</p>

<p>When they came to the very edge of the
forest, Chouse dashed around and jumped
up and down in great excitement. At last
they had reached the place to which he had
been leading them. And no wonder that
Chouse was so excited, for right in front of
them, just a few feet from the line of trees,
there was a fire!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Father, will the whole forest burn
down?" asked Greta, as she watched the
flames which crackled through the pile of
twigs and underbrush.</p>

<p>"No, Greta. Thanks to Chouse, we got
here in time. But if the wind should change
suddenly, the whole forest could very easily
burn down."</p>

<p>"How did such a fire ever get started?"</p>

<p>"I told old Peter to clear out some of the
twigs and underbrush," explained her father,
"but I also told him that he must never
go away when these piles were burning. He
must stay with them every minute."</p>

<p>"I wonder where he is now?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. But he should be right
here, watching this fire."</p>

<p>"If the wind did change, how would he put
out the fire?"</p>

<p>"By throwing earth on it, Greta."</p>

<p>While they were talking, Chouse was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
standing near by, wagging his tail and looking
very proud of himself.</p>

</div>

<p>"Chouse, you are the best dog in the whole
wide world," said the happy little girl. "First<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
you rescued my kittens and now you have
saved the whole forest from burning. We
couldn't possibly send Chouse away. Could
we, Father?"</p>

<p>Her father didn't answer right away. Finally
he said, "By the way, Greta, have you
named the kittens yet?"</p>

<p>"No, I haven't. I've been trying to think
of some very special sort of names, but I
just can't think of any."</p>

<p>"Maybe Anna can help you find the right
names," her father suggested.</p>

<p>"Of course she can. But I wonder when
Anna is coming? I haven't heard from her
yet."</p>

<p>"Why don't you run home and see if you
got a letter this morning? I must stay here
and watch this fire until old Peter comes."</p>

<p>"All right, Father."</p>

<p>It didn't take Greta long to get home.
Even Chouse could hardly keep up with her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
She hadn't been away from her kittens for
this long a time since the day Chouse had
rescued them. You would never know now
that they had been almost drowned. Their
fur was just as soft and fluffy as it had ever
been.</p>

<p>"Oh, there you are, Greta. I've been looking
everywhere for you." Her mother
greeted her at the door of the house. "Here
is a letter for you from Anna."</p>

<p>Greta read the letter eagerly.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"<i>Dear Greta:</i></p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>Thank you for your nice invitation. I
shall be very happy to come. Can you meet

<p>"You mean the beautiful castle up on the
hill," asked Greta, "the one that I have always
wanted to visit?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, that very castle."</p>

<p>"But I thought that Mr. Christianson
didn't live there any more?"</p>

<p>"He has been away for many years, but
now he has come back to live in Vosborg."</p>

<p>"And you mean that <i>I</i> can go, and Hans,
and Anna, too?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Greta."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>Mother</i>!" Greta threw her arms
around her mother's neck. "I must tell
Hans right away." And off she dashed, with
Chouse at her heels.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a><span class="small">CHAPTER V</span><br />THE STORKS</h2>


<p>"Greta, I didn't know that you had storks
on your farm," said Anna.</p>

<p>"Of course we do," said Greta. "Every
farm has a nest of storks."</p>

<p>Hans and Greta had been showing Anna
the garden and the river and all the animals
on the farm. Greta herself had almost forgotten
about the storks, because she was so
used to them. And anyway, they weren't
animals you could play with, like the kittens
and the dog.</p>

<p>"They bring us good luck," explained
Hans. "Every farmer puts up an old wheel,
or something else that is round, so the storks
can build their nest on it. Sometimes he puts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
it on the roof of the barn and sometimes on
the house."</p>

<p>"Don't you have storks at home, Anna?"
asked Greta.</p>

<p>"Goodness, no! I don't think there's a
stork in all Copenhagen, except maybe in the
zoo." Anna couldn't take her eyes from the
large round nest on the roof of the barn.
"Do they stay here all the year round?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"It's too cold for them here in the winter.
When cold weather comes, they all fly south.
Father says that some of them go as far as
Africa. But early in the spring they always
come back."</p>

<p>"Does the same family of storks come back
every year?" asked Anna.</p>

<p>"We <i>think</i> it's the same family," answered
Greta, "but we're never really sure, for you
can't ever get very near the storks."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">

<span class="caption">THE STORKS</span>
</div>

<p>While the children had been talking, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
of the storks was
standing on one leg on
the edge of the nest.</p>

<p>"That's the papa
stork that you see
now," explained Hans.
"He's away most of
the day, gathering
food, but every now
and then he comes
back to the nest to
rest. He always stands
on one leg, just like
that, when he rests."</p>

<p>"The mama stork has to stay on the nest
all the time until the eggs hatch," said Greta.
"Sometimes she stands up for a little while,
but she never flies away."</p>

<p>"I wonder how many eggs there are."
Anna was more interested in the storks than
in anything else on the farm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>"Only four this year," said Hans. "I
climbed up on the roof yesterday to find out.
Some years there are five, and sometimes
only three."</p>

<p>"My, but you <i>are</i> brave, Hans!" Anna
looked at Hans in admiration. "That roof
is terribly steep. I know <i>I'd</i> be afraid to
climb it."</p>

<p>"But you are only a girl, Anna," teased
Hans.</p>

<p>"Just the same, I can climb as well as a
boy. I'll show you." And before Hans could
argue, Anna ran over to the house and
climbed up the tree to Greta's balcony.</p>

<p>"I'll take it all back, Anna. You really <i>can</i>
climb." Hans hadn't expected this cousin
from the city to be such a tomboy. He would
have to find some other way to tease her.</p>

<p>"When will the baby storks hatch out,
Greta?" Anna couldn't get her mind off this
fascinating subject.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>"In another week or two, I expect."</p>

<p>"If the Nisser don't take the eggs first,"
said Hans.</p>

<p>"Oh, Hans, you don't <i>really</i> think they
would?" Greta was upset at the very
thought.</p>

<p>"You know how the kittens disappeared,
Greta. The same thing might happen to the
baby storks." Hans told Anna about the lost
kittens and how only two of them were
found. "Greta and I decided that the Nisser
took them," he finished.</p>

<p>"Why, Hans, how very silly!" said Anna.
"Of course the Nisser wouldn't do a thing
like that. In fact, I don't believe there is
such a thing as a Nisse anyway."</p>

<p>Greta didn't know whether to be shocked
or not. There were times when she herself
had her doubts about the Nisser, but right
now she felt sure that they were the ones
who had carried off the kittens.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Nisser don't play pranks all the time,
Anna. They do lots of nice things for us, too.
Do you see that castle on the hill over there,
with the trees all around it?"</p>

<p>Greta pointed to Vosborg Castle, about a
mile away. "Let me tell you what the Nisser
did <i>there</i> one winter. There was snow five
feet deep and it lasted for more than a week.
No one could get outdoors at all. The cows
were in the barn, where they had plenty of
food, but there were six new calves in a shed
out in the field. Everyone was afraid that
they would starve to death, but no one could
get out and feed them. When the snow
finally melted and the men went out to see the
calves, they found them fat and healthy!
The Nisser had taken care of them and fed
them during the snowstorm."</p>

<p>"So you see there really <i>are</i> Nisser," said
Hans.</p>

<span class="caption">ANNA IS A TOMBOY</span>
</div>

<p>Anna wasn't at all convinced, but she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>didn't know how to argue against proof like
this. Finally she asked, "When did this happen,
Hans?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a long time ago. A hundred years
ago, I guess."</p>

<p>"Then no one can really <i>prove</i> it," argued
Anna. "It's just a story that has been told
over and over again, like a fairy tale." Anna
believed in the things she could <i>see</i>, not in
the things that people imagined they saw.</p>

<p>"We're going to this castle for dinner on
Wednesday evening," said Hans. "Then you
can ask Mr. Christianson himself. He will
certainly know whether or not this really
happened."</p>

<p>"We're going to a real castle for dinner?"
asked Anna. "That will be lots of fun. Do
you know how many rooms there are in the
castle?"</p>

<p>"At least fifty," answered Hans. "Greta
and I have never been in Vosborg, for Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
Christianson has been living in England for
a long time. But now he has come back here
to live."</p>

<p>While they were talking about the castle,
Greta's mother called to Anna. "Wouldn't
you like to write your mother, Anna, and tell
her that you arrived safely?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Tante [Aunt] Agnes. And I'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
tell her that we are going to a real castle
for dinner." Anna ran into the house in
great excitement.</p>

<p>"Hans, I wonder why Anna doesn't believe
in the Nisser," said Greta. "<i>You</i> believe in
them, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do, Greta." Hans was quiet
and thoughtful for a minute, and then a
merry twinkle came into his eyes. "Before
Anna goes back to Copenhagen, <i>she</i> will believe
in the Nisser, too."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Hans?" Greta knew
that her brother had some kind of mischief
in mind.</p>

<p>"I mean just that. She will believe in the
Nisser just as strongly as you and I believe
in them."</p>

<p>"I don't see how you're going to convince
her, Hans."</p>

<p>"<i>I'm</i> not going to convince her, Greta. The
Nisser themselves will do that." Greta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
begged and begged, but Hans would not explain.
"Just wait and you'll find out, Greta."
And Hans started off toward his boat, whistling
to Chouse to come along.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a><span class="small">CHAPTER VI</span><br />DINNER AT VOSBORG CASTLE</h2>


<p>"The carriage should be here any minute
now." Greta ran to the window again to
look down the road.</p>

<p>"The carriage!" said Anna in surprise.
"Are we going to Vosborg in a <i>carriage</i>,
Greta?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Mr. Christianson is sending his carriage
for us. He doesn't like automobiles,
so he still keeps the old coach that has belonged
to the castle for a hundred years."</p>

<p>"There it is now, Greta," said Hans, who
was just as eager to visit the castle as Greta
and Anna were.</p>

<p>Soon they were all on their way to Vosborg.
Although it stood on a hill, you could hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
see the castle itself, because of the trees all
around it. After a short ride they reached
the castle's outer wall and drove through the
wide entrance, with its high tower that
formed an archway. There was a long
stretch of level ground inside the wall, before
one came to the stone bridge over the
moat. The moat was a wide, deep ditch filled
with water, which ran all the way around the
castle. In the olden days it was an important
protection, for enemies could not cross
it and thus could not reach the castle buildings.
Inside the moat there was a rampart,
or a high ridge of earth, which was also a
protection to the castle. Then there was still
another wall before one finally reached the
castle itself.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/illus076.jpg"><img src="images/th_illus076.jpg" width="400" height="290" alt="MR. CHRISTIANSON&#39;S COACH" title="MR. CHRISTIANSON&#39;S COACH" /></a>
<span class="caption">MR. CHRISTIANSON&#39;S COACH</span>
</div>

<p>"There has been a castle on this spot for
hundreds of years," Greta's mother told the
children as they rode along in the old coach.
"This building is only four hundred years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
old, so you see that it is rather new! The
castle that stood here before was destroyed
in 1532."</p>

<p>"Mother, tell Anna about the Englishman
who built the tower of Vosborg Castle,"
urged Hans.</p>

<p>"All right, Hans," said his mother. "A
long, long time ago, when the first castle was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
being built, the owner decided that he wanted
a tower on his castle that would be finer
than that of any other castle in Denmark.
He hunted the country over, but he couldn't
find anyone who could build such a grand
tower. Finally he heard of a man in England
who could do this. So he sent for this
man and told him to build a tower on Vosborg
that would be the finest in the land. The
Englishman solemnly promised that he would
do so.</p>

<p>"It took him three full years to build the
tower, for he was determined to make it the
finest in all Denmark. And it was. When it
was done he went to the owner of Vosborg
and asked if he were satisfied. The owner
was well pleased, and he paid the builder a
large sum of money. Long before this, however,
he had decided that he would test the
builder and the honesty of his work. So after
the Englishman had left the castle and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
walking down the road, a servant from Vosborg
came running after him, shouting, 'The
tower is leaning.'</p>

<p>"This was to be the test of his work. If
he turned around to look at the tower, the
owner of the castle would know that the
builder was not sure of his own work. If
there were even the smallest doubt in his
mind, he would be certain to look around at
once. But the English builder was very sure
that his work was well done. Not once did
he look back. Not for a minute did he pause
in his journey. But as he walked on, he said
to the servant from Vosborg, 'The tower does
not lean. Tell your master that I have done
my work well; he did not spend his money in
vain. He has the finest tower in all Denmark.
But also tell him that one day Vosborg
will be destroyed by a man in a blue
coat.'</p>

<p>"The servant told his master. Fear and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
astonishment ran through the castle like a
flame. Who was the mysterious man in the
blue coat who would one day destroy the
castle? No one knew. No one could even
guess. The owner of Vosborg was well liked
by all the people. Surely no one would do
him harm. The years went by and the castle
remained unharmed. Gradually everyone
forgot about the prophecy of the English
builder. The man in the blue coat was no
longer feared.</p>

<p>"Then one year there was a dreadful storm
on the ocean. Never before had the people
seen such an angry sea. The waves dashed
and pounded against the shore as they had
never done before. The water rose like
a wall and spread over the land for many
miles. No one had ever seen a storm like
this one. The water pounded against the
outer wall of Vosborg. It crumbled and fell.
Within a few hours the ocean had rushed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
and washed away the rampart around the
castle. There was then just one wall left as
a protection against the angry sea. It wasn't
enough. On the second day of the storm the
waves became even more fierce and violent.
Finally, that wall crumbled and the whole
castle of Vosborg was knocked down by the
force of the waves.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/illus080.jpg"><img src="images/th_illus080.jpg" width="400" height="290" alt="THE ENTRANCE TO THE INNER COURTYARD" title="THE ENTRANCE TO THE INNER COURTYARD" /></a>
<span class="caption">THE ENTRANCE TO THE INNER COURTYARD</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thus the prophecy, told many years before,
had at last come true. The English
builder had spoken truly. Vosborg was, as
he had predicted, destroyed by a man in a
blue coat&mdash;the ocean."</p>

<p>"But I thought the ocean was several miles
away," said Anna in surprise.</p>

<p>"It is now, Anna, but in those days it was
very near. Every few hundred years the
shore line changes, due to the rising or falling
of the land. So Vosborg is now a mile
or more from the ocean."</p>

<p>By this time they had reached the courtyard
of the castle. The paving stones that
covered the ground had long ago been worn
to a smooth, polished roundness. On three
sides of the courtyard there were low, white
buildings. One of these contained the servants'
quarters and the kitchens. Another
contained the huge library of the castle. The
third was made up of the stables. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
fourth side of the courtyard stood the imposing,
four-story building that made up the
main part of the castle. In the center of the
courtyard there was a lovely, round pool.</p>

<p>"Oh, Greta, it's beautiful," said the delighted
Anna, as she looked all around her.</p>

<p>Dinner was served in the Knights' Hall, a
long, stately room on the second floor. Tall
candles lighted the banquet table and threw
flickering shadows in the far corners of the
room and against the high ceiling. The
walls were covered with brilliant paintings
of the knights and ladies who had lived at
Vosborg in olden days. Now and then, as
the candlelight caught the gleam of a bright
red waistcoat or the silken beauty of a lady's
satin gown, Greta turned suddenly to look
at the portraits. Once she thought that one
of the great ladies of long ago was smiling
at her. But when she looked again, the
lovely face showed only the calm, quiet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
beauty of a painting. Had she really smiled?
Greta could not be sure.</p>

<p>After dinner Mr. Christianson showed
them the room that King Frederick had used
when he visited Vosborg Castle many years
ago.</p>

<p>"This room used to be the chapel," explained
Mr. Christianson, "but it had to be
changed for a very amusing reason. The
owner of the castle used to put his turkeys
to roost in the chapel and even left them
there on Sunday. When the minister began
to preach, all the turkeys babbled in answer.
Of course the whole church service was upset
and the minister couldn't go on. He refused
to preach at Vosborg any more. When
the king heard what had happened, he said
that there would be no more chapel services
at this castle. So the chapel was changed
into a bedroom. Many years later a tiny
chapel was built outside the castle wall. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
is a lovely, quiet place of worship. The inside
walls are lined with moss, and the outer
walls are covered with thatch. It is really a
little temple in the woods."</p>

<p>"Could we see it, Mr. Christianson?" asked
Anna, as they were going back to the drawing-room.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's too dark out there now.
But I should be delighted to show it to you if
you care to come again, during the daytime."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'd love to. Thank you so&mdash;Oh,
what's that noise?" Anna looked at Greta,
whose face had turned white. She, too, had
heard a most unusual sound.</p>

<p>"I didn't hear any noise," said Mr. Christianson.</p>

<p>"It sounded like heavy wooden wheels,"
said Greta, who looked quite scared.</p>

<p>"It couldn't be that, Greta," said Hans.
"No one has come into the courtyard."</p>

<p>"But I heard them <i>inside</i> the castle," insisted
Greta.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course. I had forgotten." Then
Mr. Christianson explained. "A long time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
ago, when this castle was first built, the entrance
to the courtyard was in the center of
this building, instead of at the side, as it is
now. In fact, this drawing-room was built
where the entrance used to be. Up to the
very day of his death, the old coachman
never approved of this change. So every
evening, about this time, he drives his coach
and four over the old road and through the
old entrance. He has to come right through
this room and that is why you always hear
him."</p>

<p>The two girls looked at Mr. Christianson
in wonder.</p>

<p>"You mean his <i>ghost</i> drives through here
every evening?" asked Greta.</p>

<p>"Yes, Greta."</p>

<p>"But I didn't think there were any <i>real</i>
ghosts," said Anna.</p>

<p>"I don't know, my dear. No one has ever
<i>seen</i> him, but you yourself heard the rumble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
of the wooden wheels of the coach just now."</p>

<p>"I certainly heard <i>something</i>," admitted
Anna.</p>

<p>"What else could it be?" asked Hans, who
was delighted to hear Anna admit even this
much.</p>

<p>On the way home from Vosborg, Anna was
very quiet. Finally she just had to ask,
"Tante Agnes, do <i>you</i> think that was the old
coach that we heard tonight?"</p>

<p>Her aunt smiled. "I don't know, Anna. I
think you had better go to Vosborg again in
the daytime. Then you can find out for
yourself whether or not it has any ghosts."</p>

<p>"Why don't you have a windmill on your
farm, Uncle Frederick?" asked Anna.
"Every one of these farms has a big windmill."</p>

<p>Anna and her uncle and Greta were driving
through the country on their way to the
shore. Greta's father had to make a business
trip to a small town on the coast, and
he was taking the girls with him. Chouse
was comfortably curled up on the back seat.</p>

<p>"We don't need a windmill, Anna, because
we have the river."</p>

<p>"But how can the river take the place of a
windmill?" asked Anna.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">THE WINDMILLS PROVIDE ELECTRIC POWER</span>
</div>

<p>"Greta, haven't you shown Anna the dam
in the river?" asked her father. "This dam
causes the water to fall from a great height.
The force of the water, as it falls on a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
machine, provides the power that is turned
into electricity. These other farms get their
electric power from the windmills. As the
great arms are turned by the wind, they provide
power that is changed, by the machinery,
into electricity."</p>

<p>Anna had lived in Copenhagen all her life,
and everything about the country was new
to her. She liked to watch the men cutting
the hay and piling it up on the large wagons.
On some of the farms the women were also
working in the fields. This was the busiest
time of year on the farm, and everyone had
to help. Children hoed the long rows of cabbages
and potatoes and beets.</p>

<p>Every time they drove through a village,
Greta and Anna played a game to see who
could be first to find the oldest house. Each
house had a name painted in large letters
over the door or near it. This wasn't the
name of the family; it was the name of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
house itself. The year when the house was
built was usually there, too. So each girl
tried to be the first one to find the oldest
house. Greta usually found it before Anna,
because Anna saw so many other things that
interested her.</p>

<p>"What are those funny little mirrors in
front of the windows, Greta?" Anna pointed
to the two small projecting mirrors fastened
by an iron frame to the window of a small
brick house.</p>

<p>"Oh, the people put those there so that
they can sit beside the window and see who
is coming down the street," explained Greta.
"There is one mirror facing up the street
and one facing down the street. With these
mirrors they can sit in the house and still see
everything that goes on."</p>

<p>"But they have so many plants and flowers
in the windows that I don't see how they
can see anything outdoors."</p>

<span class="caption">ALONG THE SHORE OF THE NORTH SEA</span>
</div>

<p>Every home, whether in a village or on a
farm, had a large flower garden. And in
every home, large or small, there were many
plants in the windows, where they could get
the sunshine. All Denmark looked like a
large garden, for there were roses, poppies,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>peonies, iris, pansies, or other brilliant flowers
wherever one looked.</p>

<p>"Look, Greta, at the two little patches of
green grass in the middle of that field of hay.
Why in the world did the farmer skip those
spots?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you why, Anna," said her uncle.
"You will notice that those little green
patches are always on small hills. They are
the graves of Vikings."</p>

<p>"But I thought that the Vikings lived more
than a thousand years ago," interrupted
Anna.</p>

<p>"Yes, they did. They were a strong, bold
race who lived in what is now Denmark, Norway,
and Sweden. They roamed the sea and
conquered many other lands. Some of them
even went to America, long before the time
of Columbus. It is against the law for anyone
to disturb a Viking grave. You will see
many of these little mounds on the farms in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
this part of the country. The farmers never
plant anything on these graves. They carefully
plow all around them."</p>

<p>"We must be quite near the ocean now, for
there's a lighthouse," said Greta. "It would
be fun to climb to the top of it. May we,
Father?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you want to."</p>

<p>It didn't take Greta and Anna long to
climb the narrow, winding stairs. From the
top of the lighthouse they could see for many
miles over the ocean and over the land.
Heavy waves beat upon the beach, and even
as they looked, the sand hills kept shifting,
for the wind from the North Sea was very
strong. Not far away was the harbor, and
in its quiet waters some of the fishermen had
fastened their sailboats. Near by they had
hung up their nets to dry. Each net was
carefully spread over a rope that was fastened
to stakes in the ground. Other fishing
boats, with sails full spread, were far out at
sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>"Anna, do you see those people way down
the beach? I wonder what they are looking
for." Greta pointed to two women who were
evidently searching for something along the
shore.</p>

<p>"I haven't any idea. Shall we go help
them with their search? Look, Greta. Your
father is motioning to us to come down. I
think Chouse wants us, too."</p>

<p>Greta's father had to go on to the next village,
but he told the girls that they could
stay here until he came back.</p>

<p>"Chouse will take good care of you while
I'm gone," he said, "that is, if he doesn't run
off and get into some kind of mischief himself."</p>

<p>Greta and Anna were curious about the
women they had seen down the beach, so
they decided to join them. With Chouse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
jumping and barking at their heels, they ran
along the water's edge. The tide was coming
in, and every now and then a large wave
almost caught them. As they went farther
from the harbor, they found more and more
sand dunes: gently rolling hills with long
blades of grass poking up here and there
through the sand. Along this part of the
beach there were many summer cottages,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
with fences around them to keep the sand
from covering them completely.</p>

<span class="caption">ALMOST EVERY FARM HAS ITS WINDMILL</span>

<p>"Have you lost something?" asked Anna
as they came near the two women. "We'll
be glad to help you look for it."</p>

<p>"No, we haven't lost anything," answered
one of the women. "We thought we might
find some amber along the beach."</p>

<p>"Amber?" asked Greta in surprise. "I
didn't know it was found here."</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly. We have often found
some very fine pieces of amber on this very
beach."</p>

<p>"Is amber a stone?" asked Greta. "Of
course I know what it looks like, but what is
it made of?"</p>

<p>"It has taken thousands of years to form
the lovely clear yellow material that we call
amber," explained the second woman. "It
was once the sticky, yellowish fluid given off
by the pine trees. As time went by, those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
trees were buried under the ground or under
the water. The sticky fluid gradually became
hard as stone. It is those stone-like
pieces that we sometimes dig up along the
beach of the North Sea."</p>

<span class="caption">CHOUSE LIKES TO PLAY</span>
</div>

<p>"They are very valuable, aren't they?"
asked Anna.</p>

<p>"Yes, some of them are. Those that are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
perfectly clear and have no flaws always
bring a good price."</p>

<p>"We'll help you look," said Greta.</p>

<p>The two girls began to search for the little
yellow lumps that lay hidden in the sand. At
first it was fun, but after a while they got
tired. They were just about to quit, when
one of the women called out happily, "Here
is a beautiful, large piece. It must weigh a
pound."</p>

<p>The others rushed up to look at it. Amber
is very light, so it took a large piece indeed
to weigh a pound. After this they began
searching with fresh interest. Suddenly
Greta found what she thought was a beautiful
piece of amber. But when she showed it
to the two women they said it was much too
heavy for amber.</p>

<p>Greta got down on her knees and began
poking among the stones and shells. Every
now and then she dug into the sand and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
poked and looked and dug some more.
While the girls were busy in this absorbing
work, Chouse ran up and down the beach.
No one paid any attention to him. Once in
a while he ran up to Greta to see if she would
play with him. But she just pushed him
away. "Run away, Chouse. I'm too busy to
play now."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<p>When Chouse got tired of playing by himself,
he lay down on the sand near Greta,
watching her every minute. Suddenly he
noticed something wriggling along the sand
not far away. He sat up and looked. Soon
the wriggling stopped. But Chouse kept on
watching this strange object. Then he got
up and walked nearer to it, walking ever so
quietly and carefully. He simply <i>must</i> see
what this strange creature was. Greta
wasn't paying any attention to Chouse or
to the strange object near by. She was too
busy looking for amber. Chouse stood without
moving, watching the now motionless
creature.</p>

<p>"Oh, Greta, I think I've found a real piece
of amber!" Anna ran across the beach in
great excitement. When she was ten feet
from Greta she stopped in terror. "Greta!"
she screamed. "Look out! Run!"</p>

<p>Greta stood up and looked around, too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
startled to run. What had happened? Then
she saw. Not two feet away lay a green
snake, coiled and ready to strike. Greta
knew at once that this was the most poisonous
snake in all Denmark. Her father had
often warned her about it. But she simply
couldn't run. She was so frightened that
she had lost the power to move. Greta knew
that in less than a minute the snake would
strike her. She knew that she must get
away. But she couldn't.</p>

<p>At that very instant Chouse sprang forward.
He had been watching this crawling
green creature for many minutes. Now was
the time for him to act. And he did act. He
seized the snake by the neck and quickly carried
it off to a high sand dune. In less than
two minutes the snake was dead.</p>

<p>Greta sank down on the sand and Anna
rushed up to her. "Oh, Greta, are you all
right?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, Anna, I'm all right. But I was so
frightened that I couldn't move."</p>

<p>Chouse came back to Greta and she took
him in her lap. "After this, Chouse, I think
you will have to go with us wherever we go.
I am quite sure that Father won't send you
away."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a><span class="small">CHAPTER VIII</span><br />A SECOND VISIT TO VOSBORG</h2>


<p>"Are you coming with us, Hans?"</p>

<p>"Where are you going, Greta?"</p>

<p>"Oh, didn't you know? Mr. Christianson
has invited Anna and me to visit Vosborg.
He wants to show us the whole castle. I'm
sure he would be glad to have you come, too."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Greta, but I think I'll go fishing
today. Old Peter says they are biting.
Come along, Chouse." Hans started toward
the river. Chouse had run ahead and was
already waiting in the boat.</p>

<p>"Shall we go on our bicycles, Greta?"
asked Anna, who never walked any place if
she could take her bicycle.</p>

<p>"No, let's walk. It's only a mile; besides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
it's way too steep a hill to climb on a bicycle."</p>

<p>The girls walked happily down the road,
never once looking back. If they had looked
back, they would have seen something very
strange. Hans had started down the river,
but he suddenly stopped the boat when he
reached the first bend. He paddled over
near the shore and drew the boat up on the
bank. Then he cautiously hid behind a large
tree trunk. The strange thing was that he
didn't take his fishing pole out of the boat.
He stood behind the tree for quite a little
while, watching Greta and Anna as they hurried
along to Vosborg.</p>

<p>When the girls were out of sight, Hans
called to the dog. "Come, Chouse. It's time
for us to go now." They got into the boat
again and Hans paddled slowly and quietly.
But Greta and Anna had reached the turn in
the road, so they could not possibly see which
way Hans was going.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>In the field outside
the castle wall, two
storks were walking
around on their long,
slender legs. The
girls stopped to
watch them.</p>

<p>"Oh, Greta, I wish
we could get up
close to them." Anna
ran forward. She
thought the storks
couldn't possibly see
her. But when she was still twenty feet away
they lifted their large wings and rose in the
air. Soon they had gone over the tops of the
trees and high into the sky. Anna watched
them until they were out of sight.</p>

<p>"What would you like to see first?" asked
Mr. Christianson, when he greeted his two
young visitors at the door.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>Both girls spoke at the same time. "The
little chapel," said Anna. "The library,"
said Greta.</p>

<p>They visited the chapel first, and then
came back to the castle by way of a lovely,
shaded path which ran by the side of the
moat.</p>

<p>"Hans Christian Andersen used to walk
along here, when he visited Vosborg," said
Mr. Christianson. "He thought up many of
his fairy tales as he strolled along under
these trees. In the library there is a volume
of his stories that I want to show you. Andersen
gave this book to my grandfather,
and in the front he has written a little verse
about Vosborg."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose we might climb up in the
tower?" asked Anna, after they had gone all
through the garden and had come back into
the inner courtyard. Anna was very fond of
climbing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course you may." Mr. Christianson
took them up narrow stairs that kept going
up and up and up. Finally they reached the
top. From here they could see the ocean in
the distance.</p>

<p>"This is almost as high as the tower in our
forest," said Greta.</p>

<p>"In olden times this tower was very useful,"
explained Mr. Christianson. "From
here one could see an enemy when he was
still miles away."</p>

<p>"Denmark doesn't have any enemies now,
does it?" asked Anna.</p>

<p>"No, Denmark is one of the most peaceful
countries in the world. It is almost eighty
years since we have been at war with any
other nation."</p>

<p>After a while they went down to the library.
Mr. Christianson led the girls past
rows and rows of books, placed on shelves
that reached from the floor to the ceiling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
When they came to the farthest corner of
the room he stopped and reached for the
book of Andersen's Fairy Tales without even
looking.</p>

<p>"You see, I know just where it is." Then
a worried look came on his face. "Why, I
can't understand this," he said. "This book
was here last night, for I showed it to some
friends. And now it is gone."</p>

<p>"Maybe someone has borrowed it," suggested
Greta.</p>

<p>"That is impossible, for I keep the library
locked, and none of the servants has the
key."</p>

<p>"Maybe you put it back in the wrong
place," suggested Anna.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that is impossible, too. You
see I keep this book in a very special place
because I prize it more than any other book
that I own. I am always careful to put it
back in this same spot."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">THE COURTYARD OF VOSBORG</span>
</div>

<p>"We'll help you look for it," offered Greta.
So the three began searching one shelf of
books after another.</p>

<p>"I suppose Hans would say that one of the
Nisser had taken it," said Anna jokingly,
when they had gone about halfway through
the shelves of books.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be at all surprised if one <i>had</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
taken it," answered Greta quite seriously.</p>

<p>They kept on looking for almost an hour.
By this time Mr. Christianson was really
worried. He finally called in all the servants
and asked if any of them had been in the library
that day. None of them had. The disappearance
of the book had become a real
mystery.</p>

<p>"I should hate to lose this book more than
any other book in the library."</p>

<p>"Let's look once more on the shelf where
it's supposed to be," said Anna.</p>

<p>Mr. Christianson laughed. "But we
looked there very carefully when we first
came in."</p>

<p>Anna wanted to look there again, so she
ran down the long room to the special shelf.</p>

<p>"Here it is!" she shouted. "Right here on
the shelf where it is always kept."</p>

<p>The others rushed up at once. "Well, this
<i>is</i> strange," said Mr. Christianson. "It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
wasn't here an hour ago, and no one has been
in this part of the room since then."</p>

<p>"Except maybe a Nisse," said Greta.</p>

<p>In the front of the book Hans Christian
Andersen had written a beautiful poem
about Vosborg. It was no wonder that Mr.
Christianson treasured this book, for Andersen
is the most famous writer of all Denmark.
Children all over the world love his
fairy tales.</p>

<p>"It's getting late, Greta, and I think we
should&mdash;" began Anna and then stopped. A
long, low moan cut through the stillness of
the room. It seemed to come from quite
near.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what was that?" asked Greta.</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose that was Lady Margaret,"
explained Mr. Christianson. "About a hundred
years ago she was kept a prisoner in
this room for many years, and every now
and then we hear her moaning."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you ever see her?" asked Anna.</p>

<p>"Well, no, I never did. But whenever we
hear that low moan from this room we know
it is Lady Margaret."</p>

<p>"Doesn't it frighten you?" asked Greta.</p>

<p>"Oh, no. We are quite used to it."</p>

<p>"This is really a haunted castle, isn't it?"
asked Anna.</p>

<p>"Every castle in Denmark has at least <i>one</i>
ghost, Anna."</p>

<p>All the way home the girls talked about
the ghost of Lady Margaret. Anna was beginning
to think that maybe there really
<i>were</i> such things as ghosts and Nisser.
When they reached the house, Hans was just
getting out of his boat.</p>

<p>"Did you get any fish, Hans?" called Anna.</p>

<p>"No luck today, Anna."</p>

<p>"Are you sure you were trying to catch
fish?" asked Greta, in her most teasing manner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you mean by that, Greta?"</p>

<p>"I thought maybe you had decided to go
after books instead."</p>

<p>Anna looked at Hans. Could he have
been playing a joke on them at Vosborg?
Was it Hans who had taken the book and
then put it back? But how could he have
gotten into the library? And anyway, she
and Greta had both seen him start down the
river in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Just then Greta's mother called from the
door. "Anna, you have a letter from your
mother."</p>

<p>"It's too bad you didn't take Chouse with
you today, Greta," said Hans, when Anna
had gone into the house.</p>

<p>"Why? What happened?"</p>

<p>"He was naughtier than he's ever been before.
He chased the young turkeys all over
the place and injured three or four of them."</p>

<p>"Did Father see him?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes. He came along just as Chouse
caught one of the turkeys and he was terribly
angry. You know how proud Father
is of those turkeys."</p>

<p>"Oh, Hans, what <i>am</i> I going to do?"
sobbed Greta. "We can't seem to break
Chouse of his awful habit of chasing things.
And yet I can't bear to part with him."</p>

<p>Just then Anna came running out of the
house. "Greta, I have the grandest news.
Mother wants you to come to Copenhagen
with me when I go home."</p>

<p>For a moment Greta forgot her worries
about Chouse. "Oh, Anna, that will be wonderful.
Let's ask Mother if I may go."</p>

<p>It was soon decided that Greta would go
back to Copenhagen with Anna. At dinner
that evening the girls talked about nothing
else, for Greta had never been in Copenhagen
before.</p>

<p>"While you are away, Greta, I'll look
around and find a new home for Chouse,"
her father announced suddenly.</p>

<p>At last it had come&mdash;this terrible thing
that she had been dreading.</p>

<p>"But I thought that Chouse had been a
very good dog lately." For the moment
Greta had forgotten Hans's report about the
turkeys.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>"I had hoped he would learn to behave better,"
said her father, "but today he injured
several of the young turkeys, and I just <i>can't</i>
have it, Greta. So we must find another
home for him. I know how you love Chouse,
and I hate to do this, but I don't see any other
way out."</p>

<p>"Why can't Chouse come to Copenhagen
with us?" asked Anna, hoping that maybe
this would solve the problem, at least for
a while.</p>

<p>"Do you think your mother would want
him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I'm sure it would be all right with
Mother," said Anna. "We don't have any
chickens or turkeys, so Chouse couldn't very
well get into mischief at my house."</p>

<p>Greta's father hesitated a minute or two
before he answered, while Greta watched
him anxiously. "All right, Anna, Chouse
may go to Copenhagen with you and Greta."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>Greta sank back in her chair with a deep
sigh. By the time she came home from Copenhagen,
the whole matter would probably
be forgotten. At any rate, the evil day had
been postponed.</p>

<p>When the day came for Greta and Anna to
leave for Copenhagen, the whole family
went to the train with them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>Hans gave Chouse a goodbye pat on the
head. "Take good care of my little sister,
Chouse," he said.</p>

<p>"And you take good care of the kittens,
Hans," warned Greta.</p>

<p>Soon all the goodbyes were said and the
two girls were on the train.</p>

<p>"I wish we could get seats by the window,"
said Greta. They walked up and down the
aisle, which was on one side of the train, but
there wasn't a single empty seat beside a
window. Each car was divided into a dozen
sections, like little rooms, with two long
seats facing each other. There was space
for four people on each seat, or eight people
in each section. The girls sat down in a section
where there were only three people. At
the very next station, two of them got off,
and then there was a vacant seat beside the
window. Greta and Anna decided to take
turns at sitting there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>"What time will it be when we reach
Copenhagen, Anna?"</p>

<p>"After seven o'clock. You see we have
to cross the peninsula of Jutland and then
the island of Zealand before we come to
Copenhagen."</p>

<p>"I have never seen a really large city before,
Anna."</p>

<p>"You will love Copenhagen, Greta. It has
such beautiful parks and shops and castles
and, oh, <i>everything</i>!"</p>

<p>"Oh, look, Anna, here we are at Lemvig already.
Do you know the story about Lemvig?"</p>

<p>"No; what is it?"</p>

<p>"A long, long time ago, when Denmark
was at war with Sweden, the Swedish soldiers
had been ordered to march upon Lemvig
and take the town. You can see that
almost the whole town is down in the valley;
there are just a few houses on the hills. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
soldiers couldn't see the town at all, so they
asked a farmer where it was. He pointed to
the houses on the hill on the other side of the
valley. Then the Swedish soldiers rode very
fast, keeping their eyes on these houses on
the distant hill. They didn't see the valley at
all and they rode so fast that they all fell
down the hill and into the river. So Lemvig
wasn't captured after all."</p>

<p>As the train started again and left Lemvig,
Anna leaned out the window. "Oh, it's
too late now," she said sadly.</p>

<p>"Too late for what?" asked Greta.</p>

<p>"I wanted to get an ice-cream bar, but the
train started just as the boy with the ice-cream
bars came up to our window."</p>

<p>"We'll surely get one at the next town,
Anna."</p>

<p>As soon as the train stopped again, Anna
let down the window and they each bought
an ice-cream bar and also one for Chouse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
He had been standing on Greta's lap, with
his front feet on the window sill, watching
with great interest as they passed fields of
yellow hay, forests of evergreens, pastures
with large herds of cows, and great fields of
cabbage and beets.</p>

<p>When they had finally ridden clear across
Jutland, which forms the main part of Denmark,
and then across the island of Funen,
which is connected with the mainland by a
large bridge, they came to a wide stretch of
water called the Great Belt.</p>

<p>"Get your suitcase, Anna," said Greta.
"We will have to get off the train and take a
boat here."</p>

<p>Anna laughed, but she didn't make a move
to get her suitcase down from the rack overhead.</p>

<p>"The whole train takes the boat, Greta.
We don't have to get off at all."</p>

<p>"The whole train? But how can it?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>"Just look out the window and you'll see
for yourself."</p>

<p>The railroad tracks ran to the very edge
of the water, where a large ferry boat was
waiting for the train. It had tracks on it,
too, and the train ran right on to the boat.
Greta could hardly believe her eyes. To
think that one could ride on a train and a
boat at the same time! It took about two
hours to cross the water, and then they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
on the island of Zealand. The boat went
right up to the railroad tracks and the train
was soon on land again and speeding on its
way.</p>

<p>"Everything here looks so different," remarked
Greta, as she looked out the window.
"There are so many more trees, and it isn't
so flat as it is at home."</p>

<p>Before long they reached the large railroad
station in Copenhagen, where Anna's
mother was waiting for them.</p>

<p>"Your father will be here very soon, Anna,
and then we are all going to Tivoli for
dinner."</p>

<p>"Is Tivoli a restaurant?" asked Greta.</p>

<p>"No, Tivoli is one of the most famous
parks in all the world," explained Anna.
"It's right in the center of Copenhagen. In
fact, it's right next to this station. Oh, I
wish Father would hurry."</p>

<p>When Greta first saw Tivoli she thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
she was in fairyland. Surely it couldn't be
real. The gay beds of flowers and the tinkling
fountains and the colored lights
among the trees all seemed to be part of a
magic world. Besides all this beauty, Tivoli
had many restaurants and theatres and
places for concerts and games and other
amusements.</p>

<p>They had dinner in one of the outdoor restaurants,
and Greta was so interested in
watching the people as they passed by that
she could hardly eat. After dinner they
started to walk through the park and let
Greta decide for herself what she would
most enjoy. When they had gone only a
little way they came to a large open stage,
where a play was being given. They all
stopped to watch it for a few minutes, and
Greta wouldn't leave the spot. To her it was
the most fascinating thing in Tivoli.</p>

<p>Suddenly she noticed that something had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
gone wrong on the stage. The actors
seemed confused and they hesitated over
their lines. What could be the matter?
Then, to her horror, she saw Chouse run
across the stage and jump up on one of the
actors. He was a young lad who looked
something like Hans. Chouse soon saw his
mistake and began wandering around the
large stage as if he were lost. The audience
laughed. They knew that this wasn't part
of the play, and it seemed very funny to
them.</p>

<p>The minute that Greta saw Chouse she
started toward the stage. Going around to
the back, where the audience could not see
her, she whistled and called to her dog.
Chouse was glad to hear his name. Happily
he ran off the stage at once and the play
went on.</p>

<p>"I think we had better go home now," said
Anna's father, when Greta came back with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
the dog, "before Chouse gets into any more
mischief."</p>

<p>Greta's heart sank. They had barely gotten
into Copenhagen&mdash;in fact, they hadn't
even reached Anna's home yet&mdash;and Chouse
had already gotten into mischief. What in
the world was she going to do with him?</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a><span class="small">CHAPTER X</span><br />A DAY OF HAPPY SURPRISES</h2>


<p>"Anna, please don't walk so fast," begged
Greta. The two girls were walking down
Langelinie, the beautiful parkway along the
ocean. Greta was much shorter than Anna
and she could not walk nearly so fast. Then,
too, she liked to stop and watch the boats
coming into the harbor. The name Copenhagen
means "merchants' harbor," and this
city has one of the finest harbors in Europe.
All kinds of ships, from tiny sailboats to
large ocean liners, come here from all parts
of the world.</p>

<p>When they had gone a little farther, Greta
wanted to sit down and rest.</p>

<p>"Can't you walk just a tiny bit more,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
Greta? On the other side of this little bay
there is someone I want you to meet."</p>

<p>"Who, Anna?"</p>

<p>"She is called 'Den Lille Havfrue,'" said
Anna.</p>

<p>"'Den Lille Havfrue,'" repeated Greta.
"'The Little Ocean Lady.' I still don't understand,
Anna. Who can this be?"</p>

<p>"Just keep on walking, and I'll show you,"
answered Anna in her most mysterious manner.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the girls had gone
around the bay.</p>

<p>"Oh, Anna, how beautiful she is!" said the
delighted Greta. Sitting on a rock at the
edge of the water was the statue of a lovely
mermaid&mdash;"the little ocean lady."</p>

<p>"She looks like a real live person," went
on Greta, "except for her fish's tail instead
of feet. Is there really such a person as a
mermaid, Anna?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">A SIDE VIEW OF THE GEFION FOUNTAIN</span>
</div>

<p>"I'm not sure, Greta, whether there is or
not. But if there really is a Nisse, then
maybe there are mermaids, too. This Little
Mermaid is the most beautiful statue in Copenhagen.
Some people think it is the loveliest
one in all Europe."</p>

<p>"How large is Copenhagen, Anna?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">THE GEFION FOUNTAIN</span>
</div>

<p>"It has about a million people. That's a
third of the whole population of Denmark."</p>

<p>After a short walk the girls came to a
large fountain, the largest that Greta had
ever seen. At the top of the fountain there
was a statue of four oxen, hitched to a plow
and driven by a woman.</p>

<p>"This is called the Gefion Fountain, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
it shows how the island of Zealand was
made," explained Anna. "There is an old,
old story that says that Denmark was given
permission to take as much of Sweden as one
could plow around in a day. So the ruler of
Denmark changed her four sons into oxen
and with them she plowed out the island on
which Copenhagen stands. This statue
shows how she had to whip them and urge
them on in order to plow out this large island
before night came."</p>

<p>"Oh, I wish we had brought Chouse
along," said Greta. "He would love to play
in this fountain."</p>

<p>"Chouse likes to play in lots of places
where he shouldn't. I think it's a good thing
that we left him home. He was very naughty
at Tivoli the other night."</p>

<p>"He didn't mean to be naughty, Anna.
Don't you think we can take him with us
sometime?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>"Maybe; sometime," said Anna.</p>

<p>As the girls walked along they stopped
now and then to look in the shop windows.
Whenever Greta saw a window full of beautiful
silverware or china she wanted to stop
and buy a gift for her mother. This china,
decorated with figures in a soft blue color,
was called Royal Copenhagen Porcelain, and
it was famous all over the world. The silverware
was designed by a Danish artist named
Georg Jensen, and it was also very famous.</p>

<p>"You will have lots of time to buy a gift
for your mother, Greta. Don't stop now. I
hope you aren't tired, for we have a hard
climb ahead of us."</p>

<p>"A climb? Why, there isn't a hill in all
Copenhagen."</p>

<p>"Do you see that church with the dome-shaped
roof that's all green and shiny?
Well, that's what we are going to climb."</p>

<p>"Oh, Anna, how can we? Why, it's taller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
than any of the other buildings in Copenhagen."
Greta looked around her at the
four- and five-story buildings. The shiny
green dome of the church rose far above
them.</p>

<p>"It is usually called the Marble Church,"
explained Anna, "because it is built of marble.
Its real name is Frederick's Church,
because it was built by King Frederick the
Fifth."</p>

<p>"That shiny green dome isn't made of
marble, is it?" asked Greta.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," laughed Anna. "The church
cost a great deal to build, and when they had
gotten as far as the dome, there was no
money left. So all the housewives in Copenhagen
gave their copper kettles to be melted
up and used to make the dome of the church."</p>

<p>Inside the church it was cool and quiet.
The girls started up the stairs and climbed
for quite a while without saying a word.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
Greta began to think that they would never
reach the top.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/illus137.jpg"><img src="images/th_illus137.jpg" width="400" height="290" alt="A COUNTRY SCENE" title="A COUNTRY SCENE" /></a>
<span class="caption">A COUNTRY SCENE</span>
</div>

<p>"Is it much farther, Anna?"</p>

<p>"This is the easy part of the climb, Greta.
Don't give up yet."</p>

<p>They kept on climbing. The stairs wound
round and round, and as the girls went
higher and higher the stairs became more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
and more narrow. Finally they came to the
place where the stairs were so narrow and so
steep that a rope had been hung from the
top to help those who climbed. It was like
climbing the side of a mountain.</p>

<p>"Now we've come to the hard part," said
Anna. "Take hold of this rope and don't let
go."</p>

<p>"Anna, do you think we ought to go any
higher?" Greta was frightened but she
didn't want to admit it.</p>

<p>"Why, of course. There is no point in
climbing this far and then stopping. You
aren't afraid, are you, Greta?"</p>

<p>"I guess not."</p>

<p>"Don't look down at all, and then you'll be
all right," advised Anna.</p>

<p>All of a sudden Greta remembered what
her father had told her when she was climbing
the tower in the forest. "A girl who is
named after a queen must not be afraid of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
anything." After all, what was there to be
afraid of? The stairs were narrow and
steep, but she would hold tightly to the rope
and she would be quite safe.</p>

<p>When Greta was about ten steps from the
top, she did glance down and saw a handkerchief
lying on the step below her. Very
carefully she backed down one step, holding
to the rope with her left hand and clutching
her purse with her right. As she took her
left hand off the rope to pick up the handkerchief,
she started to lose her balance. In terror
she grabbed at the rope. She didn't fall,
but the handkerchief fell six or seven steps
below her.</p>

<p>Anna had reached the top and called down
to Greta. "What's the matter, Greta? You
mustn't stop now, when you are almost at
the top."</p>

<p>"Did you drop your handkerchief, Anna?
There is one here on the stairs."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>Anna felt in all her pockets. "No, I didn't
drop mine, Greta."</p>

<p>Greta backed down the steps slowly and
carefully. This time she would not let go
of the rope at all. She laid her purse on the
step above while she picked up the tiny handkerchief
and put it in her pocket. In a short
time she had reached the top of the stairs,
where Anna was waiting for her. Greta
showed her the dainty little handkerchief,
with its wide border of lace.</p>

<p>"Look, Greta. It has an 'I' embroidered in
one corner."</p>

<p>"I wonder whose it is, Anna."</p>

<p>As the girls walked out on the platform on
top of the dome, they almost ran into two
beautifully dressed ladies. Greta made her
prettiest curtsy.</p>

<p>"Perhaps this handkerchief is yours," she
said, holding it out to them.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, it is," said the taller of the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
ladies. "Thank you very much, my dear."
She and her companion then started down
the narrow stairway.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I have seen that lady before, but
I can't remember where," said Anna, when
they had gone. "Come over here, Greta. I
want to show you the King's palace."</p>

<p>Just a block away from the Marble Church
was Amalienborg, the palace of the King.
The palace consisted of four beautiful buildings,
built around a large open square. Day
and night, a tall guard in uniform marched
slowly back and forth in front of the palace.
King Christian is probably the best loved
king in all Europe, and no one would ever
want to harm him. Nevertheless, the guard
is always there.</p>

<span class="caption">THE KING&#39;S GUARD</span>
</div>

<p>"That is the famous Round Tower over
there," explained Anna. "Some day we will
climb up in it. The building with all the
dragons on the roof is the Stock Exchange."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
Anna went on to point
out other interesting
buildings. Greta was
most interested in the
harbor and the hundreds
of boats, which
seemed to be everywhere
in the city. Little
arms of the sea come
right into the heart of
Copenhagen, so there
really are boats and
bridges wherever one
looks.</p>

<p>Finally the girls started home. After a
long bus ride, they walked the few remaining
blocks to Anna's home.</p>

<p>"Anna, why does that building have so
many little porches? Do they all belong to
one house?" Greta pointed to a long brick
building that had fully a hundred porches.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's a new apartment building, Greta.
More than a hundred families live there, and
each family has its own little sun porch.
Notice how each porch is built up solid on
one side, but the other side and the top are
open. In that way, every porch gets lots of
sunshine, but the neighbors can't possibly see
in it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>"They look more like bird cages than
porches," said Greta.</p>

<p>"Oh, Greta," exclaimed Anna suddenly.
"I believe that was the Princess."</p>

<p>"Who, Anna?"</p>

<p>"Why, the lady whose handkerchief you
found. Let's hurry home and ask Mother.
I'm sure she will know."</p>

<p>Greta told Anna's mother about the finding
of the handkerchief, and Anna described
the two ladies.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose it could have been Princess
Ingrid, Mother?"</p>

<p>"I think it must have been, Anna. And
the other lady was her sister Louise. You
know that Princess Ingrid, the wife of our
Crown Prince, is a Swedish princess by birth.
Today's newspaper says that Princess Louise
has come from Sweden to visit her sister Ingrid.
Here is their picture. Does it look
like the two whom you saw?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>Both girls looked at the paper eagerly.
"Yes, it <i>was</i> Princess Ingrid and Princess
Louise," said Greta. "Oh, I must write Hans
about this. He has never even <i>seen</i> a Princess.
And now I have seen two of them and
even talked to one."</p>

<p>"Now it's our turn to show <i>you</i> some castles,
Greta," said Anna, as she and her
mother and Greta got in the car. Anna's
mother had promised to take the girls on an
all-day trip to northern Zealand. This part
of Denmark is as full of castles as a plum-cake
is full of plums.</p>

<p>After driving about twenty-five miles
along the shore, they came to Kronborg
Castle, in the town of Elsinore.</p>

<p>"This is the most famous castle in Denmark,"
said Anna's mother.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Greta.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">KRONBORG CASTLE</span>
</div>

<p>"Haven't you ever read 'Hamlet,' Greta?"
asked Anna in surprise. "Kronborg Castle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
is where Hamlet lived. Only Shakespeare
called it Elsinore, which is the name of the
town instead of the castle."</p>

<p>As she walked across the old drawbridge
and entered the outer yard of the castle,
Greta thought that Kronborg was the loveliest
castle she had ever seen. It was much
larger and much more wonderful than Vosborg.
When they came to the drawbridge
across the second moat, Anna pointed out
the high battlement where the ghost of the
murdered king once walked.</p>

<p>"Does he still walk there, Anna?" asked
Greta.</p>

<p>"Maybe he does, Greta. All we really
know about him is what Shakespeare tells
us in his play."</p>

<p>When they crossed the last bridge and
passed through the last gateway into the inner
courtyard of Kronborg, Greta stopped
in surprise. "Oh, Anna, it's so large and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
beautiful." Then, just to show that she
wasn't really afraid of climbing, she asked,
"Tante Elsie, do you suppose we could climb
to the top of one of the towers?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so."</p>

<p>From the little balcony on the tower they
looked out over the ocean.</p>

<p>"Is that an island across the water?"
asked Greta.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Greta. That is Sweden, only
three miles away. In the olden days, Kronborg
was a fortress that guarded the entrance
to the Baltic Sea. All the ships that
came from the North Sea into the Kattegat
and then into the Baltic had to pass this point
of land, and every ship that went by here
had to pay money to Denmark. Up here in
this very tower there were guards who
watched all the ships to see that every one
stopped and paid for the privilege of going
past this point. In those days, Kronborg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
was the most important castle in Denmark."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<span class="caption">THE MOAT AROUND KRONBORG</span>
</div>

<p>"Don't they have to pay this money now?"</p>

<p>"No. About a hundred years ago Denmark
stopped asking for this payment.
Ships that are going to the Baltic Sea can
now go through the Kiel Canal in Germany,
instead of going all the way around Denmark,"
explained Anna's mother.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>As they walked down the narrow, winding
stairs, Anna suddenly exclaimed, "Oh,
Mother, we forgot to tell Greta why Kronborg
is still an important castle."</p>

<p>"Maybe she already knows."</p>

<p>"No, I don't. Please tell me, Anna."</p>

<p>"According to an old, old story, Holger the
Dane sleeps in the dungeon that is deep below
this tower. If Denmark is ever in trouble
of any kind, he will awake and come to
her rescue."</p>

<p>"I've heard of Holger the Dane, of course,"
said Greta, "but I thought he was just an imaginary
person."</p>

<p>"He's no more imaginary than a Nisse,"
said Anna, with a twinkle in her eye.</p>

<p>Greta hated to leave Kronborg, but when
Anna told her that they were going to see
even finer castles than this one, she was willing
to go. After driving about fifteen miles,
they turned off the main road and drove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
down a long avenue of beech trees. At the
end of this avenue there was a large white
building, with a four-cornered tower rising
from the center.</p>

<p>"This is Fredensborg Palace, where the
King and Queen live in the autumn," said
Anna. "The King comes here for the hunting
season."</p>

<p>"Can we go inside this palace?" asked
Greta. "I would love to see the Queen's own
room."</p>

<p>"Of course you would, little Margrete,"
said Tante Elsie. "We will ask the guide to
show us the Queen's apartments."</p>

<p>It seemed to Greta that the guide took
them through miles and miles of rooms.
Even then, he showed them only a part of
the two hundred and seventy rooms. The
palace was much larger than it looked from
the front, for it was very long.</p>

<p>"Surely this isn't the <i>Queen's</i> room," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
Greta, as she stood in the doorway of the
large, sunny bedroom.</p>

<p>"Why not, Greta?" asked Anna in surprise.</p>

<p>"Why, I thought it would be a very grand
room, with furniture of gold."</p>

<p>Tante Elsie laughed. "Oh, Greta, you
forget that the King and Queen of Denmark
are people of simple tastes. This is a beautiful
room, and it shows that the Queen likes
lovely things. But it also shows that she
does not spend money just to make a grand
display."</p>

<p>"Perhaps the young lady would like to see
the ballroom," said the guide. "I think she
will find that it is all that she imagined and
really fit for a queen."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>He led them through several drawing-rooms
and then into the ballroom. It was a
large, square room, with windows clear up
to the ceiling. The walls and ceiling were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
light blue, so that it seemed as if the room
were open to the sky.</p>

<p>"This is what I always thought a royal
palace would be like," said Greta in deep contentment.</p>

<p>"The ceiling of this room is eighty-one
feet high," explained the guide. "It forms
the tower in the middle of the palace."</p>

<p>Greta didn't want to leave this lovely room.
She was fascinated by the pictures painted
on the walls, the gorgeous hangings at the
windows, and the large groups of glass
candlesticks that hung from the ceiling and
sparkled like icicles as the sun shone on
them.</p>

<p>"Do you want to see the Queen's crown?"
asked Anna, as they reluctantly left the
beautiful ballroom.</p>

<p>"The Queen's crown?" said Greta. "The
Queen is in Copenhagen now; surely her
crown wouldn't be here at Fredensborg."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>"She has a crown here, too. It is really
lovelier than the one she wears at court,"
said Anna.</p>

<p>When they came to the garden behind the
palace, Greta saw what Anna meant. In the
middle of the sloping green lawn there was
a huge bed of pansies, arranged in the shape
of a crown. In the lower part of the crown
the pansies were all purple, and in the upper
part they were all gold.</p>

<p>"You are right, Anna. This is prettier
than any crown of real gold."</p>

<p>"Come, girls. We must be on our way
now," said Anna's mother. "We have a long
ride ahead of us."</p>

<p>"Are we going to see <i>another</i> castle?"
asked Greta.</p>

<p>"Yes, the finest one of all."</p>

<span class="caption">THE COURTYARD OF FREDERIKSBORG</span>

<p>After a short drive through a large forest
of beech trees, they came to Frederiksborg
Castle. It was built on three small islands in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
the center of a lake. The castle itself was so
large that it covered the islands completely
and seemed to rise up out of the water itself.
When King Frederick built the first castle
here, nearly four hundred years ago, he purposely
chose these islands in the center of a
lake because they were the safest place for a
castle. Enemies could not easily reach it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
here. When this old, old castle was destroyed
by fire, a much finer one was built on
the islands.</p>

<span class="caption">FREDENSBORG PALACE</span>
</div>

<p>As they crossed the bridge to the main
part of the castle, Greta saw two women entering
the main doorway.</p>

<p>"Look, Anna," she said in great excitement.
"Isn't that Princess Ingrid and Princess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
Louise going into the castle right this
minute?"</p>

<p>When Anna looked, the women had disappeared.
Greta was now more eager than
ever to visit the castle. Maybe she would
see her beloved Princess Ingrid again.
Would the Princess remember the little girl
who had found her handkerchief on the stairs
of the Marble Church? Greta wondered.
She was anxious to go inside, but Anna
stopped in the courtyard to listen to the
chimes on the castle tower. Every hour of
the day the ringing chimes played a different
tune.</p>

<p>"Let's see the Knights' Hall first," suggested
Anna, when they went inside.</p>

<p>Greta wanted to say, "Let's follow Princess
Ingrid," but she didn't know which way
the Princess had gone. So she followed
Anna without a word. The Knights' Hall
was the largest room Greta had ever seen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
The walls were covered with hangings whose
colored threads were woven in such a way as
to show scenes from Danish history. Greta
thought she would like to study history if
she could learn it from pictures like these instead
of from textbooks. While she was
looking at one of the hangings in a far corner
of the room, Anna grabbed her arm.</p>

<p>"There they go, Greta. Don't you want to
follow them?"</p>

<p>Then Greta remembered that Princess
Ingrid was here in the castle. How could she
have forgotten? She and Anna and Tante
Elsie left the Knights' Hall and entered the
long series of drawing-rooms that filled one
wing of Frederiksborg. Greta scarcely
looked at the paintings that hung on every
wall. She wanted to see a real live princess,
not a painted lady in a golden frame. They
walked slowly through room after room, but
not a glimpse of the Princess did they get.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>"I guess Princess Ingrid and her sister
have left the castle," said Greta, in an unhappy
tone. She was ready now to leave it
herself, for it held no further interest for
her.</p>

<p>"Now for the most wonderful room of all,"
said Anna, after they had gone through all
the drawing-rooms. She almost had to drag
Greta to the chapel, which formed an important
part of the castle itself. When the
royal family lived at Frederiksborg, services
were held here every Sunday. This chapel
was really as large as a church. As they
came in, the organist was playing softly, and
Greta sat down to listen to the music, while
Anna and her mother went to look at the
paintings which were on exhibition in the
balcony of the chapel.</p>

<p>Afterwards, Greta never remembered exactly
how it happened. She must have closed
her eyes for a minute in order to enjoy the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
music completely. The first thing she remembered
was a soft voice saying, "Are you
all alone here, my dear?"</p>

<p>When Greta had opened her eyes and recognized
the speaker she jumped to her feet.
"Why, it's the little girl who found my handkerchief
the other day. How very nice to see
you again. When we saw you here asleep,
we thought you had gotten lost in this great
castle."</p>

<p>Greta explained that her aunt and her
cousin were up in the balcony. Then her eyes
shone like stars and her heart almost skipped
a beat as the lovely Princess Ingrid took a
rosebud from the bouquet which she carried
and held it out to Greta. "Perhaps you
would like to wear this little flower," she said
in her gentle way. Then, with another smile,
she and the Princess Louise went out of the
chapel.</p>

<p>Greta stood like one in a dream. Now she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
knew how the knights of olden times felt
when they had been honored by the King.
She, little Margrete, had a flower from the
hands of the Crown Princess of Denmark.
All her life long she would remember this
moment.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a><span class="small">CHAPTER XII</span><br />CHOUSE IS HOMESICK</h2>


<p>"Chouse, will you promise to be a <i>really</i>
good dog if we take you with us?"</p>

<p>Chouse answered Greta by barking three
times, which meant, "Yes, I will."</p>

<p>Chouse had not been allowed to go with
the girls since the evening at Tivoli. Greta
didn't want to send home any <i>more</i> bad reports
about him. Even now, she was almost
afraid to open her father's letters, for each
day she expected him to write that he had
found a new home for Chouse. Sometimes
Greta wished that her visit in Copenhagen
could go on forever. Then she would never
have to part with her pet.</p>

<p>"We'll climb up in the Round Tower first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
of all," said Anna, as she and Greta and
Chouse started off gaily for a day's wandering.
"Then you can look over the city and
decide what you want to see next."</p>

<p>As they walked through the winding
streets of the business district of Copenhagen,
Anna told Greta the story of the famous
Round Tower.</p>

<p>"It was built more than three hundred
years ago by King Christian the Fourth,"
she explained. "He wanted to do something
that would make the people remember him
always, so he built this high tower as an observatory,
where scientists could study the
stars."</p>

<p>The Round Tower stood in the very heart
of the city. At the time it was built it was the
tallest building in Copenhagen, but now the
Marble Church rose high above it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">THE ROUND TOWER</span>
</div>

<p>Just before they reached the tower, Anna
surprised Greta by saying, "This Tower is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
over a hundred feet high, but you won't have
to climb a single step to reach the top."</p>

<p>"But how do we get to the top?"</p>

<p>"You'll see in just a minute, Greta."</p>

<p>"Come, Chouse," called Greta, as the girls
reached the door of the Round Tower. The
dog had started down the street ahead of
them. He seemed to be looking for something,
but he ran back quickly when his little
mistress called.</p>

<p>Once inside the tower, the children started
up a sloping walk that went up and up and
up. At the same time it went round and
round and round, like a corkscrew. Every
little while Chouse dashed on ahead and then
came running back, barking joyously.</p>

<p>"This is the funniest tower I have ever
seen," said Greta. "Does this walk go to the
very top?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Anna. "They say that
a long time ago, when Peter the Great, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
Czar of Russia, visited Denmark he rode up
here on horseback, and at another time the
Empress Catherine drove her coach and four
up to the very top of the Round Tower."</p>

<span class="caption">THE MARBLE CHURCH, AS SEEN FROM

</div>

<p>Greta stopped a moment to look at the
winding, sloping walk. "I guess one really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
<i>could</i> drive a coach up here. It seems to be
wide enough."</p>

<p>From the platform on the top of the tower,
the girls could look out over the city and the
harbor. Wherever they looked, they saw
towers and spires&mdash;on the Parliament Building,
on the Stock Exchange, on the castles,
on the churches. Some of them were gilded
and they gleamed brightly in the sunshine.
Some of them were shiny green, like the
dome of the Marble Church.</p>

<p>"What is that building whose tower has a
crown at the top?" asked Greta.</p>

<p>"That is Christiansborg Castle, where
the Parliament meets," explained Anna.
"Would you like to visit it?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Let's go there next, if it isn't too far
away," said Greta.</p>

<p>As they walked to Christiansborg, Anna
told Greta a funny story about the Round
Tower.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>"Once upon a time a Norwegian was visiting
Copenhagen. The people he visited were
eager to show him all the wonderful and
beautiful things in the city. The Norwegians
are very proud of their own country,
you know, and they like to boast about
it. When they came to the Round Tower, the
Danish people said, 'I'm sure you haven't
anything like the Round Tower in Norway.'
The Norwegian looked at it a minute and
then answered, 'No, but if we had, it would
be bigger and rounder.'"</p>

<p>Greta laughed. "But it <i>couldn't</i> be
rounder, could it, Anna?"</p>

<p>"No, of course not. If a thing is round, it's
round; you can't make it more or less round."</p>

<p>When they came to the entrance of Christiansborg,
the guard told them that dogs
were not allowed inside the castle.</p>

<p>"What will we do with him, Greta?" asked
Anna.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>"He will have to wait here at the door for
us," said Greta. Turning to the dog she
spoke to him very sternly, "Chouse, you must
be a good dog and stay right here until Anna
and I come out."</p>

<p>Chouse barked twice, as if to say, "All
right," and then he lay down on the floor beside
the guard.</p>

<p>"There has been a castle on this spot for
eight hundred years," said Anna, as they
walked through the long hall.</p>

<p>"But this castle looks quite new."</p>

<p>"Oh, there have been three or four castles
here. When one burned down, they built
another one. This one is about forty years
old. It was really built as a home for the
King, but he has never lived here. He likes
Amalienborg better."</p>

<p>"I think I would, too," said Greta. "These
rooms are so large and the ceilings are so
high that it wouldn't seem like a home at all."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">CHRISTIANSBORG CASTLE</span>
</div>

<p>In one part of the castle there were two
large halls, where the Parliament meets. One
hall was for the House of Commons and the
other was for the Upper House. Parliament
did not meet during the summer, so Greta
and Anna were allowed to visit both these
stately halls. Greta thought they had seen
everything in Christiansborg, when Anna
suddenly announced, "We're going downstairs
now, Greta. The most interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
part of Christiansborg is under the ground."</p>

<p>They went down a narrow stairway and
carefully made their way through a dark,
underground passage. Soon they came to a
scattered heap of stones that marked the outlines
of an old, old castle.</p>

<p>"This is the very first castle that was built
here," explained Anna. "It was built by
Bishop Absalon in 1167, when Copenhagen
was just a little fishing village. Here is the
old well that has been used for hundreds of
years," she said as they walked on farther,
"and here is a part of the Blue Tower where
Princess Leonora Christina was kept a
prisoner for many years."</p>

<p>"Oh, how could they keep anyone in such
a terrible dungeon?" asked Greta, who
shivered at the thought of spending even an
hour in this gloomy place. "Let's go upstairs,
Anna."</p>

<p>"All right," agreed Anna. "I wonder how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
Chouse and the guard have been getting
along."</p>

<p>The guard looked extremely worried when
the girls appeared. Chouse was nowhere in
sight.</p>

<p>"I turned my back for just a minute," he
said, "but when I turned around again your
little dog was gone. He must have run outside,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
for you can see that he isn't here in the
entrance hall."</p>

<p>Greta was so upset that she couldn't say a
word.</p>

<p>"Come on, Greta. We shall have to go and
hunt for him," said the practical Anna.
"You go in one direction and I'll go in the
other, and we'll meet here at Christiansborg
in one hour."</p>

<p>There wasn't anything for Greta to do but
to start looking. There was no use in telling
Anna that she didn't know one street from
another. There was no use in saying that she
didn't have the faintest idea of where to look.
Anna had already started in the other direction
and Greta heard her calling, every now
and then, "Here, Chouse. Come, Chouse."</p>

<p>So Greta started off bravely by herself.
Christiansborg was built on a small island, so
she crossed the Marble Bridge to the mainland
and began walking slowly along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
street by the side of the water. The shore
was lined with fishing boats and on the sidewalk
there were hundreds of little stands
where the women were selling fresh fish
which they took right out of the boats. Now
and then Greta stopped to ask one of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
if she had seen a little
black and white dog.
Not a one of them had
seen him.</p>

<p>Greta decided that
Chouse had not come
along this street, so she
walked back to the
bridge and started
down another street.
Soon she came into a
large open square filled
with fruit and vegetable
stands. The housewives of Copenhagen
came here every morning during the summer
to get the finest of fresh foods. Greta went
from one stand to another, asking if they had
seen her dog. Surely <i>someone</i> had seen him.
Finally she came to the very last stand, where
a pretty girl was selling flowers. By this time
tears had filled Greta's eyes and there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
such a lump in her throat that she could
hardly speak.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said the pretty girl. "I did
see a little black and white dog not very long
ago, but I don't know which way he went
from here."</p>

<p>Greta smiled happily at this news. At last
she was on the right trail. She left the market
and took one of the narrow, winding
streets that led through the main business
district. Every little while she called, "Here,
Chouse. Come, Chouse." But no little dog
came in answer to her call. Maybe she had
taken the wrong street after all.</p>

<p>Half blinded with tears she started across
one of the large open squares. When part
way across she saw Chouse trotting down the
street ahead of her. Greta started to run
and almost bumped into a bicycle. She was
not used to city streets, crowded with bicycles
and automobiles. By the time she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
crossed the square, Chouse had disappeared.</p>

<p>Greta was tired and hungry, but she didn't
stop to think about that. She was very much
afraid that she couldn't find her way back to
Christiansborg, but she didn't dare to think
about that. Chouse was somewhere on the
street in front of her, and she must find him.
So the little girl kept on walking. The street<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
had many curves, like all the older streets in
Copenhagen. In some places the sidewalk
was so narrow that Greta had to step out in
the street to pass the people who stood looking
in the shop windows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly a terrible fear came over Greta.
What if she <i>never</i> found Chouse? But she
simply <i>must</i> find him&mdash;and keep him. She
knew now just how dear he was to her. As
she walked along, the tears which filled her
eyes spilled over on her cheeks. She had
never been in this part of the city before, and
now she was lost just as completely as Chouse
was. Oh, if only she could find him, nothing
else would matter. In some way she would
get back to Christiansborg and Anna. In
some way she would persuade her father not
to send Chouse away. She looked at her
watch. Goodness, she had already been
walking an hour and a half! Anna would be
worried about her. But Greta felt that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
must keep on looking for her dog. She knew
now that she was on the right street, at least.</p>

<p>Suddenly Greta came into a large open
square that seemed familiar. She stopped a
minute to look around. Maybe she wasn't
really lost, after all. What was that large
building over to the left? Then the tears
stopped and her face broke into a happy
smile. Why, it was the railroad station,
where she had first come into Copenhagen.
She lost all her fears about being lost, but a
great wave of homesickness came over the
little girl. Without quite knowing why, she
crossed the busy square and went into the
station.</p>

<p>She would sit down in the station and rest
a little bit before going on with her search.
Just as she found a seat on one of the long
benches a familiar little black and white figure
caught her eye. Tired as she was, Greta
ran down the long station. Everyone turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
to watch the excited little girl who was running
so desperately. At last she reached
him, and it really was her beloved Chouse.</p>

<p>He jumped up at her and barked joyously.
"Oh, Chouse, <i>why</i> did you run away?" Greta
took him in her arms and hugged him close.
Then all of a sudden she understood why he
had gone away. Right in front of her was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
the gate to the very train that she would take
back home. Chouse was homesick, too. That
was why he had come straight to the railroad
station.</p>

<p>"Everything is all right, Chouse. We will
be going home soon," said Greta, as a single
happy tear fell on his black and white fur.</p>

<p>That evening at dinner the two girls told
all about their adventures.</p>

<p>"How did you finally get back to Christiansborg,
Greta?" asked her aunt.</p>

<p>"I asked a policeman to show me the way,
and he was kind enough to go all the way
back there with me. I don't think I could
ever have found it by myself."</p>

<p>"Oh, Greta, I almost forgot," said her aunt.
"Here is a letter that came for you today."</p>

<p>It was a letter from Hans, and Greta
opened it eagerly.</p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>"Dear Greta:</i></p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>I have some very good news for you.
Father has decided that you may keep</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span><i>Chouse after all. He found that it was the
rabbits, and not Chouse, who had been killing
the chickens. Every time we saw Chouse
running after chickens he was really trying
to get the rabbits.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>We all miss you, Greta, and I think the
kittens miss you as much as we do. They are
getting so fat that you won't know them unless
you come home pretty soon. Give
Chouse three pats for me.</i></p>

<p style="padding-right:5%" class="blockquot right"><i>Your loving brother,</i></p>
<p class="blockquot right"><i>Hans."</i></p>

<p>Greta showed the letter to Anna, saying,
"I think it's time for me to go home, Anna.
The kittens need me, and you can see that
Chouse is very homesick."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that Chouse isn't the only one
who is homesick," teased Tante Elsie. "But
we do understand, Greta. We want you to
stay as long as you can, but if you should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
at home with your pets, then you do what you
think is best."</p>

<span class="caption">GRETA AND ANNA</span>
</div>

<p>"Thank you, Tante Elsie. You have all
been so wonderful to me and you have given
me such a very good time. I shall never forget
it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>Greta decided that she would go home the
next day, so her uncle sent a telegram to her
father. Anna helped her to pack, while
Chouse stood by and watched.</p>

<p>"Of course it is really Chouse who is homesick,
Anna," insisted Greta. "I could stay
away all summer."</p>

<p>"Certainly you could," agreed Anna. "But
I expect the kittens really do need you to
look after them."</p>

<p>When Anna and Tante Elsie put Greta on
the train the next day she was very brave.
She had never before been on the train by
herself, but she was not going to let anyone
know that she was just a wee bit frightened.
After all, Chouse was with her, and this time
he would not get away from her. He seemed
just as happy as she was to be going back
home.</p>

<p>Greta kissed Anna and Tante Elsie goodbye.
"This has been such a lovely summer,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
she said. "I hope Anna can come to visit me
again next summer."</p>

<p>"And we want you to come back to Copenhagen
next year," said Anna.</p>

<p>Greta waved to them until she could no
longer see their handkerchiefs waving to her
in answer. Then she leaned back in her seat,
with Chouse on her lap.</p>

<p>"Chouse, this <i>has</i> been the grandest summer
we have ever had," said Greta, giving
her pet a loving hug. Then she took a withered
rosebud from her purse and looked at it
dreamily. "And I know that I am the
happiest girl in all Denmark."</p>
